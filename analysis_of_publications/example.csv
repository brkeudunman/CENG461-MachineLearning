TPE conjugated islet amyloid polypeptide probe for detection of peptide oligomers.,"Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), also known as amylin, is a polypeptide hormone co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells. In general, IAPP is soluble and lacks a defined structure. However, under certain conditions, these peptides tend to aggregate into soluble oligomers, eventually forming insoluble amyloid fibrils with typical cross-β-sheet structures. Amylin aggregates, therefore, have been regarded as one of the hallmarks of type II diabetes (T2D). Among these aggregated species, oligomers were shown to exhibit significant cytotoxicity, leading to impaired β-cell function and reduced β-cell mass. Monitoring of oligomer appearance during IAPP fibrillation is of particular interest. In this study, we successfully grafted an aggregation-induced emission molecule, tetraphenylethylene (TPE), at the N-terminus of IAPP. By mixing a small amount of TPE-labeled IAPP with unlabeled IAPP, we were able to detect an increase in TPE fluorescence during the nucleation phase of IAPP aggregation in vitro. It may enable real-time monitoring of IAPP oligomer formation and is further applied in the diagnosis of T2D.",Aggregation-induced emission;Amyloid probes;Islet amyloid polypeptide;Oligomers;Type II diabetes,diabetes
MATHEMATICAL MODEL FOR PREDICTING FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL IN DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS.,"The aim: To substantiate the use of data on patients' lifestyle, parameters of blood glucose, heart rate, blood pressure and bread units to build a mathematical model for predicting fasting blood glucose level in diabetes mellitus patients to improve existing measures for diabetes prevention. Materials and methods: An open database consisting of the studied parameters of 359 people was used in the research. The linear regression method was used to predict fasting blood glucose level in diabetes mellitus patients. The statistical software IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23 was chosen for calculations. Results: To calculate the coefficients of the linear regression equation, stepwise elimination of parameters was chosen. The analysis of the coefficients of influence of independent variables on dependent showed that the greatest effect on the change in glucose level had value of consumed bread units. The model for women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes showed the highest accuracy. Conclusions: Mathematical modeling made it clear that any malnutrition or health disorders can lead to a significant change in glucose levels. The obtained models consist of a number of parameters, some of which might depend on the presence of concomitant diseases. Further studies should focus on the optimal combination of various parameters taking into account methods of treating comorbidities.", lifestyle of patients  ; linear regression equation  ; prevention of diabetes ,diabetes
Postsurgical utility of copeptin for the prediction of postoperative arginine vasopressin deficiency.,"Arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVD) following neurosurgical procedures for pituitary disorders is common and can delay discharge. Copeptin, a stable surrogate marker of arginine vasopressin, may predict postoperative AVD. The authors' aim was to assess the optimal postoperative sampling time and cut-point concentration of copeptin to predict the development of postsurgical AVD. Adults without preexisting AVD who were undergoing surgery for a pituitary lesion between February 2020 and April 2022 were eligible for study inclusion. Two samples were drawn from each patient postoperatively to assess the copeptin concentration using an immunofluorescent assay. Samples were denoted as ""early"" (within 6 hours of extubation) or ""postoperative day 1"" (POD1; within 10-30 hours of extubation). Patients were evaluated for the development of AVD. One hundred ninety-two patients (54.2% female) with a median age of 54.5 years (IQR 39.8-67.0 years) were included in the study. The median copeptin concentration at both time points was significantly lower in those with AVD (transient or permanent; n = 22, 11.5%) than in those without (early: 4.9 vs 18.7 pmol/L, p < 0.001; POD1: 3.4 vs 4.9 pmol/L, p < 0.001) but did not differ in those who developed transient versus permanent AVD. The optimal copeptin cut point for the prediction of AVD was < 8.5 pmol/L for early samples (sensitivity 0.70, specificity 0.80, positive predictive value [PPV] 0.29, negative predictive value [NPV] 0.96) and < 4.3 pmol/L for POD1 samples (sensitivity 0.82, specificity 0.63, PPV 0.22, NPV 0.96). In early samples, a copeptin cutoff of 22.9 pmol/L increased the sensitivity for the detection of AVD to 95% with an NPV of 99%. The proportion of patients who had AVD was higher (60.0% vs 8.8%, p < 0.001) and the copeptin concentration lower (early: 4.3 vs 17.0 pmol/L, p < 0.001; POD1: 2.7 vs 4.9 pmol/L, p < 0.001) among those who had undergone surgery for a craniopharyngeal duct pathology versus a pituitary adenoma. Although copeptin was lower in patients with persistent Cushing's disease than in those in remission, the difference did not reach statistical significance (early p = 0.11, POD1 p = 0.52). Furthermore, the copeptin concentration could not predict the development of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Patients without AVD who had received stress dose steroids intraoperatively had lower median early copeptin (11.7 vs 19.1 pmol/L, p = 0.027). In early postoperative copeptin samples, the optimal copeptin cut point for AVD diagnosis was < 8.5 pmol/L, and a level > 22.9 pmol/L had predicative utility in excluding AVD. Caution should be used when interpreting copeptin results, as patients administered glucocorticoids intraoperatively without AVD had lower median copeptin concentrations.",arginine vasopressin;copeptin;diabetes insipidus;pituitary surgery,diabetes
Systematic review of transcranial and endoscopic endonasal approaches for craniopharyngiomas in children: is there an evolution?,"The optimal surgical approach for pediatric craniopharyngiomas (CPs) remains a matter of debate, with selection bias classically precluding a fair comparison of outcomes between the transcranial approach (TCA) and endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA). The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the current role of EEA in the treatment of pediatric CPs and to determine whether, upon expansion of its indications, a comparison with TCA is valid. A systematic review of English-language articles published between February 2010 and June 2022 was performed to identify studies in the MEDLINE (PubMed) and Embase databases reporting on the resection of pediatric CPs. Included were articles reporting on pediatric CPs removed through TCA or EEA. Case reports, review articles, and earlier or less comprehensive series by the same center were excluded. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. Prediction intervals (PIs), heterogeneity (Q, I2, and τ2 statistics), and publication bias (funnel plot analysis) were assessed. A total of 835 patients underwent TCA (18 articles) and 403 patients underwent EEA (19 articles). Preoperatively, the mean patient age (p = 0.055, PI = 5.05-15.11), visual impairment (p = 0.08, PI = 19.1-90.5, I2 = 80%), and hypothalamic syndrome (p = 0.17, PI = 6.5-52.2, I2 = 62%) did not significantly differ between the EEA and TCA groups. Endocrine deficit (anterior pituitary deficit [p < 0.001, PI = 16.5-92.9, I2 = 81%] and diabetes insipidus [p < 0.001, PI = 6.3-60.6, I2 = 43%]) was more frequent in the EEA group. Hydrocephalus and signs/symptoms of raised intracranial pressure were significantly higher (p < 0.001, PI = 5.2-73.3, I2 = 70% vs p < 0.001, PI = 4.6-73, I2 = 62%, respectively) in the TCA group. Recurrent lesions (p = 0.52, PI = 2.7-87.3, I2 = 13%), tumor size (p = 0.25, PI = 22.1-56.8), third ventricle involvement (p = 0.053, PI = 10.9-81.3, I2 = 69%), and hypothalamic involvement (p = 0.06, PI = 8.5-83.6, I2 = 79%) did not differ significantly between the approaches. EEA was preferred (p = 0.006, PI = 26.8-70.8, I2 = 40%) for sellar-suprasellar CPs, whereas TCA was preferred for purely suprasellar CPs (p = 0.007, PI = 13.5-81.1, I2 = 61%). There was no difference between the approaches for purely intrasellar lesions (p = 0.94, PI = 0-62.7, I2 = 26%). The breadth of PIs, I2 values, and analysis of publication bias showed substantial variability among the pooled data, hindering the possibility of outcome meta-analyses. With the adoption of extended approaches, the use of EEA became appropriate for a wider spectrum of pediatric CPs, with associated excellent outcomes. Although a fair comparison between outcomes in the EEA and TCA groups was hindered because of the differences in patient populations and tumor subtypes, given the increased versatility of EEA and improved expertise in its use, surgeons can now select the optimal surgical approach based on the unique benefits and drawbacks of each pediatric CP.",craniopharyngioma;endoscopic endonasal;pediatric;pituitary surgery;transcranial,diabetes
Dual Activation of Calcium Channels Using Near-Infrared Responsive Conjugated Oligomer Nanoparticles for Precise Regulation of Blood Glucose Homeostasis.,"The rarity of efficient tools with spatiotemporal resolution and biocompatibility capabilities remains a major challenge for further progress and application of signaling manipulation. Herein, biomimetic conjugated oligomeric nanoparticles (CM-CONs) were developed to precisely modulate blood glucose homeostasis via the two-pronged activation of calcium channels. Under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, CM-CONs efficiently generate local heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby simultaneously activating thermosensitive transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) and ROS-sensitive transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) calcium channels in small intestinal endocrine cells. The activation of the channels mediates inward calcium flow and then promotes glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that CM-CONs effectively regulate glucose homeostasis in diabetic model mice upon NIR light irradiation. This work develops a two-pronged attack strategy for accurately controlling blood glucose homeostasis, holding great prospects in the treatment for diabetes.",biomimetic;blood glucose homeostasis;calcium channels;conjugated oligomer;near-infrared,diabetes
Charitable medication distribution improves care for uninsured patients with diabetes.,"This study examined the impact of insulin products donated by a pharmaceutical manufacturer and dispensed by Dispensary of Hope-partnered pharmacies on medication access and treatment outcomes among uninsured patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This was a pilot, single-center, retrospective observational study. Uninsured patients with diabetes who were newly established with Ascension Medical Group clinics for the treatment of T2D were included in this study. Participants were prescribed insulin glargine, insulin isophane, or insulin isophane/insulin regular insulin therapy between March 2020 and August 2021. A retrospective chart review was conducted. Information collected included participants' hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months; change in HbA1c level; insulin prescribed; fill history; whether they had been referred to a patient assistance program; and whether they were seen by a pharmacist under a collaborative practice agreement. Thirty-eight participants were assessed, and 22 met criteria for the primary outcome. The mean HbA1c level decreased from 11.2% at baseline to 8.9% at 3 months and 8.8% at 6 months, resulting in a mean change in HbA1c of -2.4 percentage points (P = .033). Eleven participants (50%) had an HbA1c level of less than 9% at 6 months. The mean proportion of days covered was 76%. The mean monthly savings for insulin ranged from $183.74 (insulin isophane) to $253.84 (insulin glargine) per participant. Our results showed a significant improvement in glycemic control among participants, demonstrating the substantial impact that pharmacies partnered with charitable medication distributors such as the Dispensary of Hope can have on individuals with insulin-treated T2D.",,diabetes
Evaluation of Sella Turcica Morphology and Morphometry Based on Gender and Age in Our Population Using Computed Tomography.,"In this study, it was aimed to determine the reference values for the healthy Turkish population by evaluating the age-related changes in the morphology and morphometry of Sella Turcica (ST) and the relationship with the body mass index. In addition, it has been investigated whether the morphology and morphometry of this structure vary in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. The study group was consisted of a total of 524 individuals (266 females and 258 males) (426 healthy and 48 with DM) between the ages of 1 and 80, who applied to the Department of Radiology between January 2018 and February 2021. Axial brain computed tomography scans which have no pathology in ST were retrospectively examined. The ST length (STL), height (STH), diameter (STD), processus clinoideus anterior right-left (PCAR_L), processus clinoideus posterior right-left (PCPR_L) did not differ significantly in healthy individuals and individuals with DM (P>0.05). When the ST morphology according to the ST shape classification performed by Meyer Marcotti and colleagues and Axellson and colleagues was evaluated, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). There was a significant difference in STL, STD values (P<0.05), however, there was no difference in STH, PCAR_L, PCPR_L values between genders (P>0.05). While the distance between STL, STD, PCAR_L showed a significant difference between the decades in all groups, there was no significant difference in the STH, PCPR_L in both classifications (P>0.05). When the relationship between the parameters and body mass index was evaluated, STL, STD, PCAR_L showed a significant difference between the groups (P<0.05). Detailed knowledge of the ST anatomy will be helpful in terms of early diagnosis of diseases that may be related and guiding surgical interventions in this region.",,diabetes

Use of FGF21 analogs for the treatment of metabolic disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"FGF21 is a hormone produced primarily by the liver with several metabolic functions, such as induction of heat production, control of glucose homeostasis, and regulation of blood lipid levels. Due to these actions, several laboratories have developed FGF21 analogs to treat patients with metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that used FGF21 analogs and analyzed metabolic outcomes. Our search yielded 236 articles, and we included eight randomized clinical trials in the meta-analysis. The use of FGF21 analogs exhibited no effect on fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, HOMA index, blood free fatty acids or systolic blood pressure. However, the treatment significantly reduced fasting insulinemia, body weight and total cholesterolemia. None of the included studies were at high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, especially due to imprecision and indirection issues. These results indicate that FGF21 analogs can potentially treat metabolic syndrome. However, more clinical trials are needed to increase the quality of evidence and confirm the effects seen thus far.",FGF21;blood glucose;blood pressure;fasting;glycated hemoglobin A;lipids;metabolic syndrome;obesity,diabetes
"Genetic polymorphisms in the angiotensin converting enzyme, actinin 3 and paraoxonase 1 genes in women with diabetes and hypertension.","To study associations between polymorphisms in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE I/D), actinin 3 (ACTN3 R577X) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1 T(-107)C) genes and chronic diseases (diabetes and hypertension) in women. Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva samples of 78 women between 18 and 59 years old used for genetic polymorphism screening. Biochemical data were collected from the medical records in Basic Health Units from Southern Brazil. Questionnaires about food consumption, physical activity level and socioeconomic status were applied. The XX genotype of ACTN3 was associated with low HDL levels and high triglycerides, total cholesterol and glucose levels. Additionally, high triglycerides and LDL levels were observed in carriers of the TT genotype of PON1, and lower total cholesterol levels were associated to the CC genotype. As expected, women with diabetes/hypertense had increased body weight, BMI (p = 0.02), waist circumference (p = 0.01), body fat percentage, blood pressure (p = 0.02), cholesterol, triglycerides (p = 0.02), and blood glucose (p = 0.01), when compared to the control group. Both ACTN3 R577X and PON1 T(-107)C polymorphisms are associated with nutritional status and blood glucose and lipid levels in women with diabetes/hypertense. These results contribute to genetic knowledge about predisposition to obesity-related diseases.",Noncommunicable diseases;anthropometric parameters;metabolic parameters;nutritional status;polymorphism,diabetes
"Time trends in preeclampsia and gestational diabetes in Denmark and Alberta, Canada, 2005-2018-A population-based cohort study.","Preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus share risk factors such as obesity and increased maternal age, which have become more prevalent in recent decades. We examined changes in the prevalence of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes between 2005 and 2018 in Denmark and Alberta, Canada, and investigated whether the observed trends can be explained by changes in maternal age, parity, multiple pregnancy, comorbidity, and body mass index (BMI) over time. This study was a register-based cohort study conducted using data from the Danish National Health Registers and the provincial health registers of Alberta, Canada. We included in the study cohort all pregnancies in 2005-2018 resulting in live-born infants and used binomial regression to estimate mean annual increases in the prevalence of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes in the two populations across the study period, adjusted for maternal characteristics. The study cohorts included 846 127 (Denmark) and 706 728 (Alberta) pregnancies. The prevalence of preeclampsia increased over the study period in Denmark (2.5% to 2.9%) and Alberta (1.7% to 2.5%), with mean annual increases of 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.04) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.05-0.07) percentage points, respectively. The prevalence of gestational diabetes also increased in Denmark (1.9% to 4.6%) and Alberta (3.9% to 9.2%), with average annual increases of 0.20 (95% CI 0.19-0.21) and 0.44 (95% CI 0.42-0.45) percentage points. Changes in the distributions of maternal age and BMI contributed to increases in the prevalence of both conditions but could not explain them entirely. The prevalence of both preeclampsia and gestational diabetes increased significantly from 2005 to 2018, which portends future increases in chronic disease rates among affected women. Increasing demand for long-term follow up and care will amplify the existing pressure on healthcare systems.",gestational diabetes;maternal characteristics;preeclampsia;pregnancy;time trends,diabetes
A monoclonal antibody activating AdipoR for type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.,"Adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are promising targets for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. In this study, we aimed to establish agonistic antibodies against AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 with a long enough half-life to provide a means of improving poor medication adherence associated with preclinical small-molecule AdipoR agonists or existing antidiabetic drugs. Monoclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing AdipoR knockout mice with human AdipoR-expressing cells. Of the antibodies shown to bind to both, an agonist antibody was obtained, which exhibited adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase-activating properties such as adiponectin and was named AdipoR-activating monoclonal antibody (AdipoRaMab). AdipoRaMab ameliorated glucose intolerance in high-fat diet-fed mice, which was not observed in AdipoR1·AdipoR2 double knockout mice. AdipoRaMab exhibited anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model, indicating its therapeutic potential in diabetes and in NASH. In addition, the results of this study indicated that AdipoRaMab may exert therapeutic effects even in a once-monthly dosing regimen through its humanization.",,diabetes
Metformin-Cimetidine Drug Interaction and Risk of Lactic Acidosis in Renal Failure: A Pharmacovigilance-Pharmacokinetic Appraisal.,"This study aimed to evaluate lactic acidosis (LA) risk when using metformin combined with histamine H2 receptor inhibitors (H2RI) in patients with renal failure (RF). This study analyzed FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data (Q4 2012 to Q4 2022) to characterize reports of LA associated with metformin alone or combined with H2RI. Using a disproportionality approach, LA risk signal in the overall population and in patients with RF was assessed. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict metformin and cimetidine pharmacokinetic changes following conventional doses of the combinations in patients with various degrees of RF. To explore its correlation with LA risk, a peak plasma metformin concentration of 3 mg/L was considered the threshold. Following the 2016 Food and Drug Administration metformin approval for mild-to-moderate RF, the percentage of patients with RF reporting LA associated with metformin combined with H2RI increased. Disproportionality analysis showed reported LA risk signal associated with metformin and cimetidine in the overall population within the study timeframe only. Furthermore, with PBPK simulations, for metformin (1,000 mg b.i.d.) with cimetidine (300 mg q.i.d. or 400 mg b.i.d.) in stage 1 of chronic kidney disease, metformin (1,000 mg b.i.d.) with cimetidine (300 mg q.i.d. or 400 mg b.i.d. or 800 mg q.d.) in stage 2, and most combinations in stage 3, the peak plasma metformin concentrations exceeded the 3 mg/L threshold. Metformin combined with cimetidine at conventional doses may cause LA in patients with mild-to-moderate RF.",,diabetes
"Lipocalin-2 Levels, Insulin Resistance, and Urinary Albumin Excretion in Type 2 Diabetes Subgroups.","Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) level in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subgroups has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate LCN2 levels, insulin resistance, urinary albumin excretion, and inflammation status in T2DM subgroups. A total of 251 patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were evaluated. LCN2, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), FPG, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were measured. Patients with diabetes were categorized into three subgroups: patients diagnosed with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) alone (FPG-DM), those with isolated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) diabetes (A1c-DM), and those who met the criteria for both FPG and HbA1c (FPG/A1c-DM). The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and adjusted LCN2 values, such as the LCN2/inflammation index (LCN2/Inf) and LCN2/creatinine (LCN2/ Cr), were calculated. The ACR, HOMA-IR, and glycosuria prevalence were significantly higher in FPG-DM than in A1c-DM. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in LCN2, eGFR, and proinflammatory cytokine levels between the two groups. Patients with FPG/A1c-DM had significantly higher LCN2, TNF-α, IL-6, and hsCRP levels than those with A1c-DM or FPG-DM. The percent difference between LCN2 and LCN2/Inf was 3.2-fold greater than that between LCN2 and LCN2/Cr in FPG/A1c-DM. The presence of FPG-DM led to a 1.8-fold increase in the prevalence of proteinuria (odds ratio, 1.876; 95% CI, 1.014 - 3.295; p < 0.001). The ability of FPG to identify proteinuria outperformed that of HbA1c (area under the curve: 0.629, 95% CI, 0.553 - 0.706 versus 0.522, 95% CI, 0.436 - 0.605, p < 0.001). LCN2 elevation may be more largely due to inflammation than kidney function, particularly in FPG/A1c-DM. Patients with FPG-DM may be at a greater risk of diabetic nephropathy and insulin resistance than those with A1c-DM.",,diabetes
A Multicenter Prospective Evaluation of the Benefits of Two Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop Systems in Glucose Control and Patient-Reported Outcomes in a Real-world Setting.,"Advanced hybrid closed-loop systems (AHCL) have been shown to improve glycemic control and patient-reported outcomes in type 1 diabetes. The aim was to analyze the outcomes of two commercially available AHCL in real life. A prospective study was performed, including adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes, AHCL naïve, from 14 centers, who initiated the use of MM780G with SmartGuard or Tandem t:slimX2 with Control-IQ. Baseline and 3-month evaluations were performed, assessing HbA1c, time in different glycemic ranges, and patient-reported outcomes. The primary outcome was the between-group time in range 70-180 mg/dL difference from beginning to end of follow-up. One hundred fifty participants were included, with 75 initiating each system (age: 39.9 ± 11.4 years [16-72]; 64% female; diabetes duration: 21.6 ± 11.9 years). Time in range increased from 61.53 ± 14.01% to 76.17 ± 9.48% (P < 0.001), with no between-group differences (P = 0.591). HbA1c decreased by 0.56% (95%CI: 0.44%, 0.68%) (6 mmol/mol, 95%CI: 5, 7) (P < 0.001), from 7.43 ± 1.07% to 6.88 ± 0.60% (58 ± 12 to 52 ± 7 mmol/mol) in the MM780G group, and from 7.14 ± 0.70% to 6.56 ± 0.53% (55 ± 8 to 48 ± 6 mmol/mol) in the Control-IQ group (both P < 0.001 to baseline, P = 0.819 between groups). No superiority of one AHCL over the other regarding fear of hypoglycemia or quality of life was found. Improvement in diabetes-related distress was higher in Control-IQ users (P = 0.012). Sleep quality was improved (PSQI: from 6.94 ± 4.06 to 6.06 ± 4.05, P = 0.004), without differences between systems. Experience with AHCL, evaluated by the INSPIRE measures, exceeded the expectations. The two AHCL provide significant improvement in glucose control and satisfaction, with no superiority of one AHCL over the other.",,diabetes
The everolimus eluting Synergy Megatron,"The Synergy MegatronTM is an everolimus-drug eluting stent that may offer advantages in the treatment of aorto-ostial disease and large proximal vessels. To report the short- to medium-term clinical outcomes from the European Synergy MegatronTM Implanters' Registry. This registry was an investigator-initiated study conducted at 14 European centers. The primary outcome was target lesion failure (TLF), defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, target vessel myocardial infarction (MI), and target lesion revascularisation. Five hundred seventy-five patients underwent PCI with MegatronTM between 2019 and 2021. Patients were 69 ± 12 years old, 26% had diabetes mellitus, 24% had moderate-severe left ventricular impairment and 59% presented with an acute coronary syndrome. 15% were deemed prohibitively high risk for surgical revascularisation. The target vessel involved the left main stem in 55%, the ostium of the RCA in 13% and was a true bifurcation (Medina 1,1,1) in 50%.  At 1 year, TLF was observed in 40 patients, with 26 (65%) occurring within the first 30 days. The cumulative incidence of TLF was 4.5% at 30 days and 8.6% (95% CI 6.3-11.7) at 1 year. The incidence of stent thrombosis was 0.5% with no late stent thromboses. By multivariate analysis, the strongest independent predictors of TLF were severe left ventricular impairment (HR 3.43, 95% CI: 1.67-6.76, p < 0.001) and a target vessel involving the left main (HR 4.00 95% CI 1.81-10.15 p = 0.001).

"Virtual screening, pharmacokinetics & MD simulation study of active phytoconstituents of ","F. carica is a small tree and commonly used as a traditional medicine against several disorders. Diabetes is currently treated with insulin and oral hypoglycemic medicines such as sulphonyl urea derivatives, bigunides, thiazolidinediones and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonists were found to be very much beneficial in the management of diabetes by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the bioactive phytoconstituents from Ficus carica Linn. against the target PPAR-γ agonist by in silico docking approach. We investigated 68 phytoconstituents as potential inhibitors of PPAR-γ agonists and the top 24 phytoconstituents were further selected for molecular docking studies. Drug ability, side effects, and ADMET analysis were determined by using MolSoft, toxtree freeware, and ADMET SAR web server, respectively. The phytoconstituents were docked with the target PPAR-γ (PDB ID: 4Y29, 1.98 Å) receptor. Quercetin-3-o-rutinoside possessed the highest G score -14.22 kcal/mol, followed by Angelicin with a G score of -13.56 kcal/mol. All the other phytoconstituents displayed good pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters with values within the permissible limits. The ligand-protein interaction was calculated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study. Subsequently, the binding free energy of the Quercetin-3-o-rutinosideand Pioglitazone complex was calculated using MMPBSA analysis. The results indicated that some of the phytoconstituents from Ficus carica have potency as an anti-diabetic agents. So, these bioactive phytoconstituents like Quercetin-3-o-glucoside, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acids may act as a good agonist for PPAR-γ.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A Cardiovascular Risk Optimization Program in People With Schizophrenia: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.,"Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of premature death in people with schizophrenia. Some modifiable factors that have been implicated include unhealthy lifestyle, medication side effects, and physical comorbidities. The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy of a 6-month, multifactorial cardiovascular risk intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk (CVR) in people with schizophrenia. We conducted a 2-arm, parallel, randomized clinical trial in a regional mental health center. Participants with at least 1 poorly controlled cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF) (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or tobacco smoking) were randomly assigned to the intervention group or to a control group. The subjects in the intervention group received a patient-centered approach that included promoting a healthy lifestyle, pharmacological management of CVRFs, psychotropic drug optimization, and motivational follow-up [Programa d'optimització del RISc CArdiovascular (PRISCA)]. The main outcome was change in CVR as assessed using the Framingham-REGICOR function, after 6 months compared with the baseline in both groups. Forty-six participants were randomly assigned to the PRISCA group (n=23) or the control group (n=23). The most prevalent CVRFs at baseline were hypercholesterolemia (84.8%) and tobacco smoking (39.1%). The PRISCA group showed a significant reduction in the REGICOR score (-0.96%; 95% CI: -1.60 to -0.32, P=0.011) after 6 months (relative risk reduction of 20.9%), with no significant changes in the control group (0.21%; 95% CI: -0.47 to 0.89, P=0.706). In the PRISCA group, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol also decreased significantly (-27.14 mg/dL; 95% CI: -46.28 to -8.00, P=0.008). A patient-centered, multifactorial cardiovascular risk intervention improved CVR in people with schizophrenia after 6 months, which was achieved mainly by improving the lipid profile.",,diabetes
To push or to pull? A clinical audit on the efficacy and safety of the pull and push percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy techniques in oncological patients.,"The peroral ""pull"" technique and the direct ""push"" procedure are the two main methods for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Although pull-PEG is generally recommended as the first-line modality, many oncological patients require a push-PEG approach to prevent tumor seeding or overcome tumor-related obstruction. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of both PEG procedures in cancer patients. We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive PEG procedures within a tertiary oncological center. Patients were followed up with the hospital databases and National Cancer Registry to assess the technical success rate for PEG placement, the rate of minor and major adverse events (AEs), and 30-day mortality rates. We compared those outcomes between the two PEG techniques. Finally, risk factors for PEG-related adverse events were analyzed using a multivariable Cox proportional-hazard regression model adjusted for patients' sex, age, performance status (ECOG), Body Mass Index (BMI), diabetes, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) status (pre-/current-/post-treatment), and type of PEG. We included 1055 PEG procedures (58.7% push-PEG/41.4% pull-PEG) performed in 994 patients between 2014 and 2021 (mean age 62.0 [±10.7] yrs.; 70.2% males; indication: head-and-neck cancer 75.9%/other cancer 24.1%). The overall technical success for PEG placement was 96.5%. Although the ""push"" technique had a higher rate of all AEs (21.4% vs. 7.1%, Hazard Ratio [HR]  = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.9-4.3, p < 0.001), most of these constituted minor AEs (71.9%), such as tube dislodgement. The methods had no significant difference regarding major AEs and 30-day mortality rates. Previous CRT was associated with an increased risk of major AEs (hazard ratio = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.0-7.2, p = 0.042). The risk of major AEs was comparable between the push- and pull-PEG techniques in cancer patients. Due to frequent tube dislodgement in push-PEG, the pull technique may be more suitable for long-term feeding. Previous CRT increases the risk of major AEs, favoring early (""prophylactic"") PEG placement when such treatment is expected.",adverse effects;enteral nutrition;gastrostomy;percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy;pull PEG;push PEG,diabetes
App-Supported Lifestyle Interventions in Pregnancy to Manage Gestational Weight Gain and Prevent Gestational Diabetes: Scoping Review.,"Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are common pregnancy complications that have been shown to be preventable through the use of lifestyle interventions. However, a significant gap exists between research on pregnancy lifestyle interventions and translation into clinical practice. App-supported interventions might aid in overcoming previous implementation barriers. The current status in this emerging research area is unknown. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of planned, ongoing, and completed studies on eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) app-supported lifestyle interventions in pregnancy to manage GWG and prevent GDM. The review assesses the scope of the literature in the field; describes the population, intervention, control, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) characteristics of included studies as well as the findings on GWG and GDM outcomes; and examines app functionalities. The scoping review was conducted according to a preregistered protocol and followed established frameworks. Four electronic databases and 2 clinical trial registers were systematically searched. All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of app-supported lifestyle interventions in pregnancy and related qualitative and quantitative research across the different study phases were considered for inclusion. Eligible studies and reports of studies were included until June 2022. Extracted data were compiled in descriptive analyses and reported in narrative, tabular, and graphical formats. This review included 97 reports from 43 lifestyle intervention studies. The number of published reports has steadily increased in recent years; of the 97 included reports, 38 (39%) were trial register entries. Of the 39 identified RCTs, 10 efficacy or effectiveness trials and 8 pilot trials had published results on GWG (18/39, 46%); of these 18 trials, 7 (39%) trials observed significant intervention effects on GWG outcomes. Of all 39 RCTs, 5 (13%) efficacy or effectiveness trials reported GDM results, but none observed significant intervention effects on GDM. The RCTs included in the review were heterogeneous in terms of their PICOS characteristics. Most of the RCTs were conducted in high-income countries, included women with overweight or obesity and from all BMI categories, delivered multicomponent interventions, delivered interventions during pregnancy only, and focused on diet and physical activity. The apps used in the studies were mostly mHealth apps that included features for self-monitoring, feedback, goal setting, prompts, and educational content. Self-monitoring was often supported by wearable activity monitors and Bluetooth-connected weight scales. Research in this field is nascent, and the effectiveness and implementability of app-supported interventions have yet to be determined. The complexity and heterogeneity of intervention approaches pose challenges in identifying the most beneficial app features and intervention components and call for consistent and comprehensive intervention and outcome reporting.",eHealth;gestational diabetes;gestational weight gain;lifestyle intervention;mHealth;mobile app;mobile health;mobile phone;obesity;overweight;pregnancy;prevention,diabetes
Single vs. dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting for unprotected left-main coronary disease.,"The use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after coronary revascularization for left-main disease is still debated. The study aimed to characterize patients who received dual vs. single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for unprotected left-main disease and compare the outcomes of those patients. This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 551 patients who were grouped into two groups: patients who received SAPT (n= 150) and those who received DAPT (n= 401). There were no differences in age (p= 0.451), gender (p= 0.063), smoking (p= 0.941), diabetes mellitus (p= 0.773), history of myocardial infarction (p= 0.709), chronic kidney disease (p= 0.615), atrial fibrillation (p= 0.306) or cerebrovascular accident (p= 0.550) between patients who received SAPT vs. DAPT. DAPTs were more commonly used in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (87 (58%) vs. 273 (68.08%); p= 0.027), after off-pump CABG (12 (8%) vs. 73 (18.2%); p= 0.003) and in patients with radial artery grafts (1 (0.67%) vs. 32 (7.98%); p<0.001). While SAPTs were more commonly used in patients with low ejection fraction (55 (36.67%) vs. 61 (15.21%); p<0.001) and in patients with postoperative acute kidney injury (27 (18%) vs. 37 (9.23%); p= 0.004). The attributed treatment effect of DAPT for follow-up MACCE was not significantly different from that of SAPT (β: -2.08 (95% confidence interval: - 20.8- 16.7); p= 0.828). The attributed treatment effect of DAPT on follow-up all-cause mortality was not significantly different from that of SAPT (β: 4.12 (95% confidence interval: - 11.1- 19.32); p= 0.595). There was no difference in bleeding between groups (p= 0.666). DAPTs were more commonly used in patients with ACS, after off-pump CABG, and with radial artery grafts. SAPTs were more commonly used in patients with low ejection fraction and acute kidney injury. Patients on DAPT after CABG for left-main disease had comparable MACCE and survival to patients on SAPT, with no difference in bleeding events.",,diabetes
Blood Pressure Effects of SGLT2 Inhibitors: Mechanisms and Clinical Evidence in Different Populations.,"Sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) are increasingly prescribed due to their considerable benefits on clinical outcomes in people with diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension is a common comorbidity in each of these disease states, increasing risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We herein review the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on blood pressure in different populations, proposed mechanisms of action, and the contribution of blood pressure lowering to end-organ protection. A recognised effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in recent clinical trials is blood pressure lowering, with multiple postulated mechanisms. This advantageous effect was first identified in populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus, prior to expansion of these trials to broader cohorts. On our review, we identified that the blood pressure lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be a dose-independent class-effect, with a magnitude of effect comparable to that seen with a low dose hydrochlorothiazide. There is considerable evidence demonstrating that this effect is observed across populations including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and resistant hypertension.",Blood pressure;Hypertension;SGLT2 inhibitors,diabetes
Effects of the Timing of Intense Physical Activity on Hypertension Risk in a General Population: A UK-Biobank Study.,"It has recently been suggested that the timing of exercise is important in the subsequent development of hypertension. We used the UK Biobank database which prospectively collates data in over 500,000 people aged between 40 and 69 years to determine the relationship between the chronoactivity pattern of exercise and the risk of incident hypertension. We analyzed data from 70,617 participants with 7-day Axivity AX3 triaxial accelerometry information available. Comparisons were made by a K-means clustering analysis separating groups according to the daily timing of physical activity and intensity. Subgroup, sensitivity analyses, and Cox proportional hazard model were performed. The mean age of the cohort was 61.17 (± 7.89) years with 40.05% men, and there was a mean follow-up of 7.54 (± 1.65) years. Participants were separated into 4 clusters with 6341 developing hypertension. Cluster 1 (early morning physical activity) and Cluster 2 (early morning and later physical activity) had a significantly reduced risk of incident hypertension (adjusted HR 0.870 [95%CI 0.812-0.932) vs. 0.895 [95%CI 0.825-0.972], respectively) when compared with Cluster 3 (physical activity intensity spread evenly throughout the day). Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 cases with High Intensity physical activity had a lower risk of hypertension; however, Low Intensity physical activity in Cluster 1 still reduced the risk of incident hypertension. There was a lower risk of hypertension in Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 in both morning and evening sleep chronotypes. The development of incident hypertension is significantly reduced in those who engage in some level of physical activity earlier in the day. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a global problem with a high economic health burden that has been shown to be a major risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular, and kidney disease. Our study has used a large maintained UK biological database to determine the impact of physical exercise on reducing the subsequent development of hypertension during follow-up from data provided by more than 70,000 participants. When we segregated patients into clusters of exercise timing, we found that the risk of developing hypertension over time was reduced for patients who performed exercise earlier in the morning than at other times of the day. This benefit was still evident even when the intensity of regular physical activity was low.",Hypertension;Patterns;Physical activity;Timing,diabetes

Obesity and glomerular filtration rate.,"Obesity has received considerable attention in general medicine and nephrology over the last few years. This condition increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, which are the main risk factors for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Kidney damage caused by obesity can be explained by many mechanisms, such as sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems activation, mechanical stress, hormonal unbalance, as well as inflammatory cytokines production. Even though creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) equations in obese individuals have been validated (Salazar-Corcoran and CKD-MCQ), changes in body weight after bariatric surgery (BS) leads to changes in creatininemia, affecting its reliability. Thus, an average between creatine and cystatin-based GFR equations would be more appropriate in this setting. Bariatric surgery can reverse diabetes mellitus and improve hypertension, which are the main causes of CKD. Conclusion: GFR can be affected by obesity and BS, and its value should be cautiously evaluated in this setting.",Bariatric surgery;Glomerular filtration rate;Obesity,diabetes
"Prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of venous thromboembolism in patients with brain tumor undergoing craniotomy: a meta-analysis.","Brain tumor patients undergoing craniotomy are significantly associated with the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE), while the contributing factors remains controversial. Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for VTE in postoperational brain tumor patients. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases from their inception to July 2023. Article selection, data extraction, and study quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's and Begg's tests. Stata 15.0 software was used for data analysis. A total of 25 studies were considered, with a total of 49,620 brain tumor individuals. The pooled prevalence of VTE during hospitalization in postoperational brain tumor patients was 9% [95% CI: (0.08, 0.10)]. Moreover, our results demonstrated that patients with VTE were older than those without VTE [mean difference [MD] = 8.14, 95% CI: (4.97, 11.30)]. The following variables were significantly associated with VTE: prior history of VTE [OR = 7.81, 95% CI: (3.62, 16.88)], congestive heart failure [OR = 2.33, 95% CI: (1.08-5.05)], diabetes [OR = 1.87, 95% CI: (1.12-3.10)], hypertension [OR = 1.27, 95% CI: (1.07-1.50)], steroid use [OR = 1.63, 95% CI: (1.41, 1.88)], high white blood cells counts [MD = 0.32, 95% CI: (0.01, 0.63)], and high fibrinogen levels [MD = 0.19, 95% CI: (0.08, 0.30)]. This meta-analysis identified risk factors for postoperational VTE in patients with brain tumor, which can serve as a theoretical foundation for medical staff to manage and treat VTE.

Association between type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have shown that there is a bidirectional relationship between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); the causality of this association remains elusive and may be affected by confusion and reverse causality. There is also a lack of large-scale randomized controlled trials to verify. Therefore, this Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to investigate the causal association between T1D and SLE. We aggregated data using publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS), all from European populations. Select independent (R2 < 0.001) and closely related to exposure (P < 5 × 10-8) as instrumental variables (IVs). The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary method. We also used MR-Egger, the weighted median method, MR-Robust, MR-Lasso, and other methods leveraged as supplements. T1D had a positive causal association with SLE (IVW, odds ratio [OR] = 1.358, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.205 - 1.530; P < 0.001). The causal association was verified in an independent validation set (IVW, OR = 1.137, 95% CI, 1.033 - 1.251; P = 0.001). SLE had a positive causal association with T1D (IVW, OR = 1.108, 95% CI, 1.074 - 1.144; P < 0.001). The causal association was verified in an independent validation set (IVW, OR = 1.085, 95% CI, 1.046 - 1.127; P < 0.001). These results have also been verified by sensitivity analysis. The MR analysis results indicated a causal association between T1D and SLE. Therefore, further research is needed to clarify the potential biological mechanism between T1D and SLE. Key Points • Observational studies have shown that there is a bidirectional relationship between T1D and SLE. • We evaluated causal effects between T1D and SLE by Mendelian randomization analyses. • The MR analysis results indicated a causal association between T1D and SLE.",Mendelian randomization;Systemic lupus erythematosus;Type 1 diabetes,diabetes
Profiling miRNAs in tear extracellular vesicles: a pilot study with implications for diagnosis of ocular diseases.,"To estimate the roles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in tears and to determine whether their profiles are associated with the type of ocular disease. Cross-sectional study. Tear EVs were extracted from 14 healthy participants and from 21 patients with retinal diseases (age-related macular degeneration [AMD] or diabetic macular edema [DME]). The surface marker expression of tear EVs was examined, and microRNAs (miRNAs) were extracted and profiled by use of real-time PCR array. The stability of the expression of the miRNAs was determined, and their functions were assessed by network analyses. Classification accuracy was evaluated by use of a random forest classifier and k-fold cross-validation. The miRNAs that were highly expressed in tear EVs were miR-323-3p, miR-548a-3p, and miR-516a-5p. The most stably expressed miRNAs independent of diseases were miR-520h and miR-146b-3p. The primary networks of the highly stably expressed endogenous miRNAs were annotated as regulation of organismal injury and abnormalities. The highly expressed miRNAs for severe retinal disease were miR-151-5p for AMD and miR-422a for DME, suggesting potential roles of tear EVs in liquid biopsy. Nine miRNAs (miR-25, miR-30d, miR-125b, miR-132, miR-150, miR-184, miR-342-3p, miR-378, and miR-518b) were identified as distinguishing individuals with AMD from healthy individuals with a classification accuracy of 91.9%. The finding that tear EVs contain characteristic miRNA species indicates that they may help in maintaining homeostasis and serve as a potential tool for disease diagnosis.",Age-related macular degeneration;Diabetic macular edema;Extracellular vesicle;Tears;miRNA,diabetes
Immersive virtual reality-based rehabilitation for subacute stroke: a randomized controlled trial.,"Few effective treatments improve upper extremity (UE) function after stroke. Immersive virtual reality (imVR) is a novel and promising strategy for stroke UE recovery. We assessed the extent to which imVR-based UE rehabilitation can augment conventional treatment and explored changes in brain functional connectivity (FC) that were related to the rehabilitation. An assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was performed with 40 subjects randomly assigned to either imVR or Control group (1:1 allocation), each receiving rehabilitation 5 times per week for 3 weeks. Subjects in the imVR received both imVR and conventional rehabilitation, while those in the Control received conventional rehabilitation only. Our primary and secondary outcomes were the Fugl-Meyer assessment's upper extremity subscale (FMA-UE) and the Barthel Index (BI), respectively. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed to assess the effectiveness of the trial. For both the FMA-UE/BI, a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used, with the FMA-UE/BI at post-intervention or at follow-up, respectively, as the dependent variable, the two groups as the independent variable, baseline FMA-UE/BI, age, sex, site, time since onset, hypertension and diabetes as covariates. Both ITT and PP analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of imVR-based rehabilitation. The FMA-UE score was greater in the imVR compared with the Control at the post-intervention (mean difference: 9.1 (95% CI 1.6, 16.6); P = 0.019) and follow-up (mean difference:11.5 (95% CI 1.9, 21.0); P = 0.020). The results were consistent for BI scores. Moreover, brain FC analysis found that the motor function improvements were associated with a change in degree in ipsilesional premotor cortex and ipsilesional dorsolateral prefrontal cortex immediately following the intervention and in ipsilesional visual region and ipsilesional middle frontal gyrus after the 12-week follow-up. ImVR-based rehabilitation is an effective tool that can improve the recovery of UE functional capabilities of subacute stroke patients when added to standard care. These improvements were associated with distinctive brain changes at two post-stroke timepoints. The study results will benefit future patients with stroke and provide evidence for a promising new method of stroke rehabilitation.

The pathogenesis of OSA-related hypertension: what are the determining factors?,"Sleep-disordered breathing has a relatively high prevalence, which varies from 3-7% in males and from 2-5% in females in the adult population. Studies published in the literature have shown that sleep apnea is closely related to an increased risk of developing various pathologies, among which arterial hypertension stands out. The prevalence of hypertension in patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ranges from 35-80% and appears to be related to OSA severity. Approximately 40-50% of patients affected by hypertension are also affected by OSA and this association seems to be stronger in young and middle-aged adults (<50 years of age). The primary objective of this narrative review is to provide an update on what are the main contributing comorbidities to the development of a hypertensive state in patients suffering from OSA, an independent risk factor for diurnal hypertension, implicated as a risk factor for the first stroke, recurrent stroke, and post-stroke mortality. There are a lot of factors that contribute to developing a hypertensive state in OSA patients, some more decisive, others less. More evidence from longitudinal studies is needed on the impact of OSA on cardiovascular risk in females, on the causal link between OSA and arterial hypertension or metabolic diseases, like diabetes and glucose intolerance, and the effect of different kinds of OSA treatment.",,diabetes
Hyperglucagonaemia and amino acid alterations in individuals with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Hyperglucagonaemia contributes to the pathophysiology in type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms behind the inappropriate glucagon secretion are not fully understood. Glucagon and amino acids are regulated in a feedback loop referred to as the liver-α cell axis. Individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) appear to be glucagon resistant, disrupting the liver-α cell axis resulting in hyperglucagonaemia and hyperaminoacidaemia. We investigated the associations between circulating glucagon, amino acids, and liver fat content in a cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes. We included 110 individuals with type 2 diabetes in this cross-sectional study. Liver fat content was quantified using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Associations between liver fat content and plasma glucagon and amino acids, respectively, were estimated in multivariate linear regression analyses. Individuals with NAFLD (n=52) had higher plasma glucagon concentrations than individuals without NAFLD (n=58). The positive association between plasma glucagon concentrations and liver fat content was confirmed in the multivariable regression analyses. Plasma concentrations of isoleucine and glutamate were increased, and glycine and serine concentrations were decreased in individuals with NAFLD. Concentrations of other amino acids were similar between individuals with and without NAFLD, and no clear association was seen between liver fat content and amino acids in the regression analyses. MRS-diagnosed NAFLD in type 2 diabetes is associated with hyperglucagonaemia and elevated plasma concentrations of isoleucine and glutamate and low plasma concentrations of glycine and serine. Whether NAFLD and glucagon resistance per se induce these changes remains to be elucidated.",,diabetes

Sex-Specific Variations in the mRNA Levels of Candidate Genes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from Patients with Diabetes: A Multistep Study.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most prevalent diseases that also show sexual dimorphism in many different aspects. This study aimed to distinguish the mRNA expression of genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in men or women with T2D using a multistep analysis. A total of 95 patients with T2D were compared based on their sex in terms of clinical variables and mRNA expression in their PBMCs. Men with T2D had lower LDLC, HDLC, and HbA1c values in their blood, but greater creatinine levels. In men with T2D, TLR4, CCR2, NOX2, and p67phox mRNA expression was greater, but IL6 and NF-κB mRNA expression was lesser in PBMCs. There was a link between fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides, and hs-CRP, as well as COX1 mRNA in men with T2D. In women with T2D, FPG was associated with the mRNA expression of THBS1 and p67phox, as well as triglycerides and HDLC levels. We found the exclusive effect of FPG on HDLC, HbA1c, as well as p67phox mRNA in PBMCs of women with T2D. Analysis revealed the exclusive effect of FPG on hs-CRP and PAFR mRNA in PBMCs of men with T2D. FPG was shown to be associated with body mass index, hs-CRP, triglycerides, and COX1 mRNA in men with T2D, and with serum triglycerides, THSB1, and p67phox mRNA in women with T2D, according to network analysis. HbA1c was linked with NF-κB mRNA in women with T2D. Using a multistep analysis, it was shown that network analysis outperformed traditional analytic techniques in identifying sex-specific alterations in mRNA gene expression in PBMCs of T2D patients. The development of sex-specific therapeutic approaches may result from an understanding of these disparities.",Diabetes;PBMCs;mRNA gene expression;multistep analysis;sex-specific differences,diabetes
G-Protein-Coupled Receptor 91-Dependent Signalling Does Not Influence Vascular Inflammation and Atherosclerosis in Hyperlipidaemic Mice.,"The TCA cycle intermediate metabolite 'succinate' has been proposed as an inflammatory mediator, influencing autoimmunity and allergic reactions, through ligation to its sensing receptor SUCNR1/GPR91. Whether GPR91-mediated signalling influences the chronic inflammatory process of atherosclerosis has never been investigated. The examination of publicly available datasets revealed that the SUCNR1 gene is expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques, especially in vascular smooth muscle cells. Using GPR91 knockout (Gpr91-/-) and wildtype (WT) littermates, made hyperlipidaemic with the overexpression of the gain-of-function mutated Pcsk9 and Western diet feeding, we showed that the full ablation of GPR91 did not accelerate atherosclerosis-lesions in the aortic arch 2.18 ± 0.48% vs. 1.64 ± 0.31%, and in the aortic roots 10.06 ± 0.91% vs. 10.67 ± 1.53% for Gpr91-/- and WT mice, respectively. In line with this, no differences between groups were observed for macrophage and T-cell infiltration in the plaque, as well as the polarization towards M1- or M2-like macrophages in the aorta, spleen and liver of Gpr91-/- and WT control mice. In conclusion, our study indicates that the global ablation of GPR91 signalling does not influence vascular inflammation or atherogenesis.",GPR91;SUCNR1;TCA;atherosclerosis;immunometabolism;inflammation;succinate,diabetes
The Proinflammatory Role of ANGPTL8 R59W Variant in Modulating Inflammation through NF-κB Signaling Pathway under TNFα Stimulation.,"Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) is known to regulate lipid metabolism and inflammation. It interacts with ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 to regulate lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and with IKK to modulate NF-κB activity. Further, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) leading to the ANGPTL8 R59W variant associates with reduced low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) and increased fasting blood glucose (FBG) in Hispanic and Arab individuals, respectively. In this study, we investigate the impact of the R59W variant on the inflammatory activity of ANGPTL8. The ANGPTL8 R59W variant was genotyped in a discovery cohort of 867 Arab individuals from Kuwait. Plasma levels of ANGPTL8 and inflammatory markers were measured and tested for associations with the genotype; the associations were tested for replication in an independent cohort of 278 Arab individuals. Impact of the ANGPTL8 R59W variant on NF-κB activity was examined using approaches including overexpression, luciferase assay, and structural modeling of binding dynamics. The ANGPTL8 R59W variant was associated with increased circulatory levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 7 (IL7). Our in vitro studies using HepG2 cells revealed an increased phosphorylation of key inflammatory proteins of the NF-κB pathway in individuals with the R59W variant as compared to those with the wild type, and TNFα stimulation further elevated it. This finding was substantiated by increased luciferase activity of NF-κB p65 with the R59W variant. Modeled structural and binding variation due to R59W change in ANGPTL8 agreed with the observed increase in NF-κB activity. ANGPTL8 R59W is associated with increased circulatory TNFα, IL7, and NF-κB p65 activity. Weak transient binding of the ANGPTL8 R59W variant explains its regulatory role on the NF-κB pathway and inflammation.",ANGPTL8;NF-κB;TNFα;glucose metabolism;single nucleotide polymorphism,diabetes
The Role of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminant Potential and DNA (Cytosine-5)-Methyltransferase Dysregulation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Diseases.,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression without altering gene sequences in health and disease. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are enzymes responsible for DNA methylation, and their dysregulation is both a pathogenic mechanism of disease and a therapeutic target. DNMTs change gene expression by methylating CpG islands within exonic and intergenic DNA regions, which typically reduces gene transcription. Initially, mutations in the DNMT genes and pathologic DNMT protein expression were found to cause hematologic diseases, like myeloproliferative disease and acute myeloid leukemia, but recently they have been shown to promote cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and pulmonary hypertension. We reviewed the regulation and functions of DNMTs, with an emphasis on somatic mutations in DNMT3A, a common cause of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminant potential (CHIP) that may also be involved in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Accumulation of somatic mutations in DNMT3A and other CHIP genes in hematopoietic cells and cardiovascular tissues creates an inflammatory environment that promotes cardiopulmonary diseases, even in the absence of hematologic disease. This review summarized the current understanding of the roles of DNMTs in maintenance and de novo methylation that contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, including PAH.",DNA methylation;Tatton-Brown-Rahman Syndrome;congenital heart disease;diabetes;epigenetic regulation;group 1 pulmonary hypertension;inflammation,diabetes
MicroRNA and Protein Cargos of Human Limbal Epithelial Cell-Derived Exosomes and Their Regulatory Roles in Limbal Stromal Cells of Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Corneas.,"Epithelial and stromal/mesenchymal limbal stem cells contribute to corneal homeostasis and cell renewal. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes (Exos), can be paracrine mediators of intercellular communication. Previously, we described cargos and regulatory roles of limbal stromal cell (LSC)-derived Exos in non-diabetic (N) and diabetic (DM) limbal epithelial cells (LECs). Presently, we quantify the miRNA and proteome profiles of human LEC-derived Exos and their regulatory roles in N- and DM-LSC. We revealed some miRNA and protein differences in DM vs. N-LEC-derived Exos' cargos, including proteins involved in Exo biogenesis and packaging that may affect Exo production and ultimately cellular crosstalk and corneal function. Treatment by N-Exos, but not by DM-Exos, enhanced wound healing in cultured N-LSCs and increased proliferation rates in N and DM LSCs vs. corresponding untreated (control) cells. N-Exos-treated LSCs reduced the keratocyte markers ALDH3A1 and lumican and increased the MSC markers CD73, CD90, and CD105 vs. control LSCs. These being opposite to the changes quantified in wounded LSCs. Overall, N-LEC Exos have a more pronounced effect on LSC wound healing, proliferation, and stem cell marker expression than DM-LEC Exos. This suggests that regulatory miRNA and protein cargo differences in DM- vs. N-LEC-derived Exos could contribute to the disease state.",RNA-seq;cellular crosstalk;diabetic cornea;exosome;extracellular vesicles;limbal epithelial cells;limbal stem cells;mesenchymal stem cells;miRNA;proteomics,diabetes
SUMOylation Modulates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Levels and Acts as a Protective Mechanism in the Type 2 Model of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the prevalent type of peripheral neuropathy; it primarily impacts extremity nerves. Its multifaceted nature makes the molecular mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy intricate and incompletely elucidated. Several types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been implicated in the development and progression of DPN, including phosphorylation, glycation, acetylation and SUMOylation. SUMOylation involves the covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to target proteins, and it plays a role in various cellular processes, including protein localization, stability, and function. While the specific relationship between high blood glucose and SUMOylation is not extensively studied, recent evidence implies its involvement in the development of DPN in type 1 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the impact of SUMOylation on the onset and progression of DPN in a type 2 diabetes model using genetically modified mutant mice lacking SUMOylation, specifically in peripheral sensory neurons (SNS-Ubc9-/-). Behavioural measurement for evoked pain, morphological analyses of nerve fibre loss in the epidermis, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and antioxidant molecules were analysed over several months in SUMOylation-deficient and control mice. Our longitudinal analysis at 30 weeks post-high-fat diet revealed that SNS-Ubc9-/- mice exhibited earlier and more pronounced thermal and mechanical sensation loss and accelerated intraepidermal nerve fibre loss compared to control mice. Mechanistically, these changes are associated with increased levels of ROS both in sensory neuronal soma and in peripheral axonal nerve endings in SNS-Ubc9-/- mice. In addition, we observed compromised detoxifying potential, impaired respiratory chain complexes, and reduced levels of protective lipids in sensory neurons upon deletion of SUMOylation in diabetic mice. Importantly, we also identified mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) as a SUMOylation target, the activity of which is negatively regulated by SUMOylation. Our results indicate that SUMOylation is an essential neuroprotective mechanism in sensory neurons in type 2 diabetes, the deletion of which causes oxidative stress and an impaired respiratory chain, resulting in energy depletion and subsequent damage to sensory neurons.",SUMOylation;high-fat diet;hyperglycaemia;malate dehydrogenase 2;reactive oxygen species;respiratory chain,diabetes
Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) to Address Gaps in Chronic Kidney Disease Education among Underserved Latines-The CARE Study.,"Ensuring equitable chronic kidney disease (CKD) education for Latine patients with low health literacy and low English proficiency stands as a critical challenge, and the ""Caridad Awareness and Education"" (CARE) initiative represents our ongoing effort to address this imperative issue. In collaboration with twenty-three patients living with CKD, diabetes and/or hypertension and twelve trained Community Health Workers (CHWs) from diverse Latine subgroups, we conducted a research initiative funded by the National Kidney Foundation. Our primary objective was to co-design and test culturally tailored patient education materials (PEMs) for underserved Latine adults at risk for or diagnosed with CKD. We effectively integrated Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) principles with a Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to create a range of CKD-PEM prototypes in Spanish. Patient preferences for printed educational materials were clear. They favored printed materials that incorporated visual content with concise text over digital, email, texts, or online resources and personalized phone outreach and the involvement of CHWs. Additionally, patients identified their unwavering commitment to their families as a forceful motivator for caring for their kidney health. Currently, a culturally and linguistically tailored CKD flipchart for one-on-one education, led by CHWs, is undergoing a pilot testing phase involving a sample of one hundred Latine patients at risk for or diagnosed with CKD. This innovative approach signifies a commitment to amplifying the insights and expertise of the Latine community afflicted by kidney health disparities, effectively embracing a CEnR to forge meaningful and impactful CKD-PEMs.",CKD awareness and screening;Latine;community-engaged research;human-centered design;underserved patients,diabetes
A Qualitative Study on Parenting Practices to Sustain Adolescent Health Behaviors in American Indian Families.,"American Indian (AI) adolescents who practice healthy behaviors of sleep, nutrition, physical activity, and limited screen time can lower their lifetime risk of diet-sensitive disease. Little is known about how AI parenting practices influence the health behaviors of youth. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore how a group of AI parents of youths at risk of disease influenced their youth's health behaviors after a family intervention. A secondary objective was to understand the role of AI parents in supporting and sustaining health behavior change in their youths following the intervention. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with AI parents (n = 11) and their young adolescents, 10-15 years old (n = 6). Parents reported facilitators to how they enacted healthy lifestyle behaviors, including family togetherness, routines, youth inclusion in cooking, and motivation due to a health condition in the family. Barriers to enacting healthy behaviors included a lack of time, a lack of access to health resources, negative role modeling, and the pervasiveness of screen media. Three major themes about the role of AI parenting emerged inductively from the interview data: ""Parenting in nontraditional families"", ""Living in the American grab-and-go culture"", and ""Being there and teaching responsibility"". The importance of culture in raising youths was emphasized. These findings inform strategies to promote long-term adherence to behavior changes within the intervention. This study contributes to public health conversations regarding approaches for AI youths and families, who are not well represented in previous health behavior research.",American Indian;diabetes;disease prevention;health promotion;obesity;parenting;wellness,diabetes
Willingness for Medical Screening in a Dental Setting-A Pilot Questionnaire Study.,"An important way to manage noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is to focus on prevention, early detection, and reducing associated risk factors. Risk factors can be detected with simple general health checks, which can also be performed in dental clinics. The purpose of this study was to investigate participants' willingness to participate in general health checks at the dentist, in particular the difference in opinion between medical patients and random healthy dental attendees. A total of 100 medical patients from an outpatient internal medicine clinic and 100 dental clinic attendees were included (total of 200 participants). The participants were asked for their opinion using six closed-ended questions. Overall, 91.0% of participants were receptive to information about the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The majority (80-90%) was receptive to screening for DM and CVD risk, such as weight and height measurements, blood pressure measurement, saliva testing for CVD and to measure glucose and cholesterol via finger stick. No significant differences were found in the frequencies of the responses between the different groups based on health status, age, sex, or cultural background. This study shows that most participants are willing to undergo medical screening at the dentist for early detection and/or prevention of common NCDs.",cardiovascular diseases;dental clinic;diabetes mellitus;health check;medical screening;noncommunicable diseases,diabetes
Feasibility and Outcomes of ,"Hispanics in the United States experience a greater burden of type-2 diabetes (T2D), with a prevalence rate (17%) more than twice that of non-Hispanic whites (8%). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among people with T2D. A culturally appropriate behavioral health intervention that addresses healthy lifestyle promotion is an impactful approach for health systems with scarce medical resources and a high prevalence of chronic conditions, including obesity and high blood pressure, which increase the likelihood of CVD mortality among type-2 diabetics. To assess the feasibility and outcomes of a behavioral intervention to decrease CVD and complications in a Hispanic diabetic population. Meta Salud Diabetes (MSD), a behavioral intervention effective in a Mexican population, consists of a 13-week intervention addressing CVD and T2D knowledge and risk reduction. It was implemented in a sample of Hispanic diabetic patients from two federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Clinical and behavioral variables were measured at baseline, postintervention, and 1-year follow-up. The feasibility of MSD was rated as successful by all FQHC staff and well-received by both staff and study participants, with positive remarks about the culturally relevant components of the intervention. The sample size was n = 30 (baseline), n = 23 (postintervention), and n = 19 (1-year follow-up). Of note, quantitative results showed trending decreases in Hba1c (7.06; 6.80; 6.30), blood pressure (132/83; 126/80; 123/78), and total cholesterol (160; 159; 154). MSD is a feasible intervention and can address the need to improve health outcomes among Hispanic patients with T2D.",behavioral intervention;cardiovascular disease;disparities;hispanic;type-2 diabetes,diabetes
Retatrutide showing promise in obesity (and type 2 diabetes).,"Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and some cancers. Retatrutide stimulates Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, and glucagon receptors, and is being developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. A phase 2 clinical trial of retatrutide (LY3437943) in the treatment of obesity. The primary end point was percentage change in weight from baseline to 24 weeks, which ranged from -7.2% to -~18% as the dose of retatrutide increased from 1 mg to 12 mg. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting). The results for retatrutide in phase 2 for obesity (and diabetes) are mostly encouraging. Consistent with being a GLP-1 receptor agonist, heart rate was increased by up to 6.7 beats/min by retatrutide, which may be detrimental and offset some of the benefits of weight loss. Presumably, retatrutide is being developed as a challenger to the recently developed weight loss medicines; semaglutide and/or tirzepatide. Thus, comparator studies are needed between retatrutide and these drugs, but none are ongoing and, in my opinion, this lack is a major omission in the development of retatrutide.",Clinical trial;diabetes;obesity;phase 2;retatrutide;semaglutide;tirzepatide,diabetes
"The vascular complications of diabetes: a review of their management, pathogenesis, and prevention.","This review highlights the pathogenesis of both microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes and how these mechanisms influence both the management and preventative strategies of these complications. The cumulative data shown in this review suggest hyperglycemic and blood pressure control remain central to this intricate process. We reviewed the literature including retrospective, prospective trials as well as meta-analysis, and post hoc analysis of randomized trials on microvascular andmacrovascular complications. Further research is needed to explore the ideal intervention targets and preventative strategies needed to prevent macrovascular complications. Furthermore, as the data for trials looking at microvascular complications lengthen more long-term data will further elucidate the role that the duration of diabetes has on these complications. Additionally, trials looking to maximize hyperglycemic control with multiple agents in diabetes, such as metformin, SGL2isand GLP-1 receptor agonists are currently in process, which will have implications for rates of microvascular as well as macrovascular complications.",Diabetic nephropathy;atherosclerosis;diabetic neuropathy;diabetic retinopathy;macrovascular diabetic complication;microvascular diabetic complication;peripheral arterial disease;venous thromboembolism,diabetes
SIKs Regulate HDAC7 Stabilization and Cytokine Recall in Late-Stage T Cell Effector Differentiation.,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying the acquisition and maintenance of effector function during T cell differentiation is important to unraveling how these processes can be dysregulated in the context of disease and manipulated for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we report the identification of a previously unappreciated regulator of murine T cell differentiation through the evaluation of a previously unreported activity of the kinase inhibitor, BioE-1197. Specifically, we demonstrate that liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-mediated activation of salt-inducible kinases epigenetically regulates cytokine recall potential in effector CD8+ and Th1 cells. Evaluation of this phenotype revealed that salt-inducible kinase-mediated phosphorylation-dependent stabilization of histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) occurred during late-stage effector differentiation. HDAC7 stabilization increased nuclear HDAC7 levels, which correlated with total and cytokine loci-specific reductions in the activating transcription mark histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac). Accordingly, HDAC7 stabilization diminished transcriptional induction of cytokine genes upon restimulation. Inhibition of this pathway during differentiation produced effector T cells epigenetically poised for enhanced cytokine recall. This work identifies a previously unrecognized target for enhancing effector T cell functionality.",,diabetes
Hemoglobin A1c as a Predictor of Surgical Site Infection in Patients With Orthopaedic Trauma.,"Previous research involving diabetes mellitus (DM), glycemic control, and complications in orthopaedic patients has primarily focused on elective procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate hemoglobin A1c (A1c) as a predictor of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) in patients with orthopaedic trauma. Patients aged 18 years or older treated surgically for an acute fracture by a fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma surgeon at a single academic tertiary referral center with a laboratory value for A1c available within 3 months of their surgery were identified retrospectively. Postoperative SSI was defined according to 'Fracture related infection: A consensus on definition from an international expert group,' by Metsemakers et al. A total of 925 patients met criteria for analysis. A receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated using A1c as a predictor for signs suggestive and confirmatory of SSI and demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.535 and 0.539, respectively. No significant difference was found in the rate of signs suggestive or confirmatory of SSI in patients with normal A1c levels (<6.5) compared with patients with A1c levels consistent with a diagnosis of DM (>6.5), P-value = 0.199 and P-value = 0.297, respectively. No significant difference was found in the rate of signs suggestive or confirmatory of SSI in patients with completely uncontrolled DM (A1c > 10) compared with patients with A1c levels <10, P-value 0.528 and P-value = 0.552, respectively. Existing literature has demonstrated an association with postoperative infection in orthopaedic patients who have elevated A1c values. In this cohort of patients with orthopaedic trauma, hemoglobin A1c was not a valuable tool to predict postoperative SSI. Given these findings, routine A1c monitoring is not a reliable predictor of SSI criteria in patients with orthopaedic trauma based on the current consensus definition of SSI in fracture surgery.",,diabetes
An updated patent review of GPR40/ FFAR1 modulators (2020 - present).,"Free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1) is a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because it could clinically stimulate insulin release in a glucose-dependent manner without inducing hypoglycemia.

Beta cell stress and endocrine function during T1D: what's next to discover?,"Canonically, Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by autoreactive T cells as perpetrators of endocrine dysfunction and beta cell death in the spiral towards loss of beta cell mass, hyperglycemia, and insulin dependence. Beta cells have mostly been considered as bystanders in a flurry of autoimmune processes. More recently, our framework for understanding and investigating T1D has evolved. It appears increasingly likely that intracellular beta cell stress is an important component of T1D etiology/pathology that perpetuates autoimmunity during the progression to T1D. Here we discuss the emerging and complex role of beta cell stress in initiating, provoking, and catalyzing T1D. We outline the bridges between hyperglycemia, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress and autoimmunity from the viewpoint of intrinsic beta cell (dys)function, and we extend this discussion to the potential role for a therapeutic beta cell stress-metabolism axis in T1D. Lastly, we mention research angles that may be pursued to improve beta cell endocrine function during T1D. Biology gleaned from studying T1D will certainly overlap to innovate therapeutic strategies for T2D, and also enhance the pursuit of creating optimized stem cell-derived beta cells as endocrine therapy.",Type 1 diabetes;beta cells;cell metabolism;endoplasmic reticulum stress;islets;oxidative stress,diabetes
"Opportunities, challenges, and future directions for simulation modeling the effects of structural racism on cancer mortality in the United States: a scoping review.","Structural racism could contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality via its broad effects on housing, economic opportunities, and health care. However, there has been limited focus on incorporating structural racism into simulation models designed to identify practice and policy strategies to support health equity. We reviewed studies evaluating structural racism and cancer mortality disparities to highlight opportunities, challenges, and future directions to capture this broad concept in simulation modeling research. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping Review Extension guidelines. Articles published between 2018 and 2023 were searched including terms related to race, ethnicity, cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, and structural racism. We included studies evaluating the effects of structural racism on racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality in the United States. A total of 8345 articles were identified, and 183 articles were included. Studies used different measures, data sources, and methods. For example, in 20 studies, racial residential segregation, one component of structural racism, was measured by indices of dissimilarity, concentration at the extremes, redlining, or isolation. Data sources included cancer registries, claims, or institutional data linked to area-level metrics from the US census or historical mortgage data. Segregation was associated with worse survival. Nine studies were location specific, and the segregation measures were developed for Black, Hispanic, and White residents. A range of measures and data sources are available to capture the effects of structural racism. We provide a set of recommendations for best practices for modelers to consider when incorporating the effects of structural racism into simulation models.",,diabetes

A qualitative study design using an ethnographic approach was adopted to understand the experiences of the Pnar women with type 2 diabetes. Around 60 women living with diabetes across 20 villages in the Thadlaskein rural block were interviewed in the Pnar language. Thematic analysis was employed to identify the pattern related to beliefs and cultural practices in the self-management of diabetes across the data set. Misconceptions related to diet, such as all vegetables grown underground need to be avoided and bitter herbs and vegetables are good for blood glucose control, were reported. Participants used home remedies and complementary and alternative medicine to bring down their blood glucose levels. Participants believe that diabetes is an episodic or short-term illness and can be cured through herbal medicine. Participants reported that consuming atta or round flat bread made of wheat flour instead of rice caused ""acidity."" Misconceptions are barriers to disease management, which are often shaped in people's minds by culture. Therefore, health care service providers must know what people think about diabetes and its management.

"Biallelic CRELD1 variants cause a multisystem syndrome including neurodevelopmental phenotypes, cardiac dysrhythmias, and frequent infections.","We sought to delineate a multisystem disorder caused by recessive CRELD1 variants. The impact of CRELD1 variants was characterized through an international collaboration utilizing next generation DNA sequencing, gene knockdown and protein overexpression in Xenopus tropicalis, and in vitro analysis of patient immune cells. Biallelic variants in CRELD1 were found in 18 participants from 14 families. Affected individuals displayed an array of phenotypes involving developmental delay, early-onset epilepsy, and hypotonia, with about half demonstrating cardiac arrhythmias and some experiencing recurrent infections. Most harbored a frameshift in trans with a missense allele, with one recurrent variant, p.(Cys192Tyr), identified in 10 families. X. tropicalis tadpoles with creld1 knockdown displayed developmental defects along with increased susceptibility to induced seizures compared to controls. Additionally, human CRELD1 harboring missense variants from affected individuals had reduced protein function, indicated by a diminished ability to induce craniofacial defects when overexpressed in X. tropicalis. Finally, baseline analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed similar proportions of immune cell subtypes in patients as compared to healthy donors.

"Innate Immune System Regulated by Stimulator of Interferon Genes, a Cytosolic DNA Sensor, Regulates Endothelial Function.","Background Sterile inflammation caused by metabolic disorders impairs endothelial function; however, the underlying mechanism by which hyperglycemia induces inflammation remains obscure. Recent studies have suggested that stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a key cytosolic DNA sensor in the innate immune system, contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. This study examines the role of the STING in endothelial dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Methods and Results Injection of streptozotocin promoted the expression of STING and DNA damage markers in the aorta of wild-type mice. Streptozotocin elevated blood glucose and lipid levels in both wild-type and STING-deficient mice, which showed no statistical differences. Genetic deletion of STING ameliorated endothelial dysfunction as determined by the vascular relaxation in response to acetylcholine (P<0.001) and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in the aorta (P<0.05) in STZ-injected mice. Endothelium-independent vascular response to sodium nitroprusside did not differ. Treatment with a direct STING agonist, cyclic GMP-AMP, or mitochondrial DNA increased inflammatory molecule expression (eg, VCAM1 and IFNB) and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, partially through the STING pathway. Cyclic GMP-AMP significantly impaired endothelial function of aortic segments obtained from wild-type mice, which was ameliorated in the presence of C-176, a STING inhibitor, or a neutralizing interferon-β antibody. Furthermore, the administration of C-176 ameliorated endothelial dysfunction in STZ-induced diabetic mice (P<0.01). Conclusions The DNA damage response regulated by STING impairs endothelial function. STING signaling may be a potential therapeutic target of endothelial dysfunction caused by hyperglycemia.",STING;diabetes;endothelial function;inflammation,diabetes
The risk factors of diabetic ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with SGLT2 inhibitors: a retrospective study.,"There is limited evidence on the safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use in the real world of China. We conducted this two-center, retrospective study to assess the incidence rate and risk factors of Dapagliflozin-associated DK/DKA among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China. Patients with T2DM treated with Dapagliflozin in Shanghai General Hospital were included in this retrospective analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed, and odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to identify the influencing factors associated with the occurrence of DK/DKA. A total of 1985 T2DM patients received Dapagliflozin for the first time were included. The prevalence of DK and DKA was 2.47% and 0.35%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression identified age <45 years [OR = 2.99, 95% CI (1.45-6.17)], concomitant use of Acarbose [OR = 2.18, 95% CI (1.06-3.38)], Metformin [OR = 1.84, 95% CI (1.01-3.38)], and Insulin [OR = 1.93, 95% CI (1.02-3.66)] as participating factors for DK/DKA. The 1:4 matched subset sensitivity analysis further confirmed the risk factors of Dapagliflozin-associated DK/DKA. Age less than 45 years, concomitant use of Acarbose and insulin were risk factors for Dapagliflozin-associated DK/DKA.

Joint Associations of Pregnancy Complications and Postpartum Maternal Renal Biomarkers With Severe Cardiovascular Morbidities: A US Racially and Ethnically Diverse Prospective Birth Cohort Study.,"Background Pregnancy complications are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Little is known about the role of renal biomarkers measured shortly after delivery, individually or in combination with pregnancy complications, in predicting subsequent severe maternal CVD. Methods and Results This study included 566 mothers of diverse races and ethnicities from the Boston Birth cohort, enrolled at delivery and followed prospectively. Plasma creatinine and CysC (cystatin C) were measured 1 to 3 days after delivery. CVD during follow-up was defined by physician diagnoses in electronic medical records. Associations of renal biomarkers and pregnancy complications with time-to-CVD events were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. During an average of 10.3±3.2 years of follow-up, 30 mothers developed 1 or more CVDs. Only a modest association was observed between creatinine and risk of CVD. In comparison, we found that per 0.1 mg/L increase of CysC was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.1-1.4) for CVD after adjusting for covariates. Compared with those without preeclampsia and with normal CysC level (≤75th percentile), mothers with preeclampsia and elevated CysC (>75th percentile) had the highest risk of CVD (HR, 4.6 [95% CI, 1.7-17.7]), whereas mothers with preeclampsia only or with elevated CysC only did not have significantly increased CVD risk. Similar synergistic effects for CVD were observed between CysC and preterm delivery. Conclusions In this sample of US, traditionally underrepresented multiracial and multiethnic high-risk mothers, elevated maternal plasma CysC, independently and jointly with pregnancy complications, increased risk of CVD later in life. These findings warrant further investigation.

"Association Between a First-Degree Family History and Self-Reported Personal History of Obesity, Diabetes, and Heart and Blood Conditions: Results From the All of Us Research Program.","Background Family history reflects the complex interplay of genetic susceptibility and shared environmental exposures and is an important risk factor for obesity, diabetes, and heart and blood conditions (ODHB). However, the overlap in family history associations between various ODHBs has not been quantified. Methods and Results We assessed the association between a self-reported family history of ODHBs and their risk in the adult population (age ≥20 years) of the AoU (All of Us) Research Program, a longitudinal cohort study of diverse participants across the United States. We conducted a family history-wide association study to systematically assess the association of a first-degree family history of 15 ODHBs in AoU. We performed stratified analyses based on racial and ethnic categories, education, household income and gender minority status, and quantified associations by type of affected relatives. Of 125 430 participants, 76.8% reported a first-degree family history of any ODHB, most commonly hypertension (n=64 982, 51.8%), high cholesterol (49 753, 39.7%), and heart attack (29 618, 23.6%). We use the FamWAS method to estimate 225 familial associations among 15 ODHBs. The results include overlapping associations between family history of different types of cardiometabolic conditions (such as type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease), and their risk factors (obesity, hypertension), where adults with a family history of 1 ODHB exhibited 1.1 to 5.6 times (1.5, on average) the odds of having a different ODHB. Conclusions Our findings inform the utility of family history data as a risk assessment and screening tool for the prevention of ODHBs and to provide additional insights into shared risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms.",All of Us;FamWAS;cardiometabolic;diabetes;family history;heart;obesity,diabetes
Development and Validation of the American Heart Association Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTs (PREVENT) Equations.,"Background: Multivariable equations are recommended by primary prevention guidelines to assess absolute risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, current equations have several limitations. Therefore, we developed and validated the AHA Predicting Risk of CVD EVENTs (PREVENT) equations among US adults aged 30-79 years without known CVD. Methods: The derivation sample included individual-level participant data from 25 datasets (N=3,281,919) between 1992-2017. The primary outcome was CVD (atherosclerotic CVD [ASCVD] and heart failure [HF]). Predictors included traditional risk factors (smoking status, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, anti-hypertensive or statin use, diabetes) and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]. Models were sex-specific, race-free, developed on the age-scale, and adjusted for competing risk of non-CVD death. Analyses were conducted in each dataset and meta-analyzed. Discrimination was assessed using Harrell's C-statistic. Calibration was calculated as the slope of the observed vs. predicted risk by decile. Additional equations to predict each CVD subtype (ASCVD, HF) and include optional predictors (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR], hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), and social deprivation index [SDI]) were also developed. External validation was performed in 3,330,085 participants from 21 additional datasets. Results: Among 6,612,004 adults included, mean (SD) age was 53 (12) years and 56% were female. Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 4.8 (3.1) years, there were 211,515 incident total CVD events. The median C-statistics in external validation for CVD were 0.794 (interquartile interval [IQI]: 0.763-0.809) in female and 0.757 (0.727-0.778) in male participants. The calibration slopes were 1.03 (IQI 0.81 -1.16) and 0.94 (0.81-1.13) among females and males, respectively. Similar estimates for discrimination and calibration were observed for ASCVD- and HF-specific models. The improvement in discrimination was small but statistically significant when UACR, HbA1c, and SDI were added together to the base model to total CVD (ΔC-statistic [IQI] 0.004 [0.004, 0.005] and 0.005 [0.004, 0.007] among females and males, respectively). Calibration improved significantly when UACR was added to the base model among those with marked albuminuria (>300mg/g) (1.05 [0.84-1.20] vs. 1.39 [1.14-1.65], p=0.01). Conclusions: PREVENT equations accurately and precisely predicted risk for incident CVD and CVD subtypes in a large, diverse, and contemporary sample of US adults using routinely available clinical variables.",,diabetes
Social Networks and Cardiovascular Disease Events in the Jackson Heart Study.,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affects Black adults. Greater social networks (SNs), or social connectedness, may lower the risk of CVD events. This study determined the association of SNs and incident CVD and tested mediation by depressive symptoms, hypertension control, and diabetes control. Methods and Results We used the Social Network Index at exam 1 (2000-2004) to develop a continuous standardized SN score and binary categories (high versus low) among participants in the Jackson Heart Study (n=4686; mean age, 54.8 years). Surveillance of coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure events occurred after exam 1 (2005 for HF) until 2016. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the association of SNs and CVD events by sex and tested the mediation of depressive symptoms, hypertension control, and diabetes control. Models adjusted for age, education, health behaviors, CVD comorbidities, and depressive symptoms. Among women, the SN score was associated with a lower hazard of stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure after full adjustment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64-0.95]; HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.71-0.88]; and HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.66-0.92], respectively). SN scores were also associated with a lower hazard of coronary heart disease in men (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.75-0.94]) after full adjustment. High versus low SNs were associated with a lower hazard of coronary heart disease and heart failure among women after full adjustment. There was no evidence of mediation by depressive symptoms, diabetes control, and hypertension control. Conclusions Higher SNs may lower the risk of CVD events, especially in women.",Black;cardiovascular disease;social connectedness;social networks;women,diabetes
Inulin prebiotic ameliorates type 1 diabetes dictating regulatory T cell homing via CCR4 to pancreatic islets and butyrogenic gut microbiota in murine model.,"Gut dysbiosis is linked to Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Inulin, a prebiotic, modulates the gut microbiota, promoting beneficial bacteria that produce essential short-chain fatty acids for immune regulation. However, how inulin affects T1D remains uncertain. Using a streptozotocin-induced (STZ) mouse model, we studied inulin's protective effects. Remarkably, STZ+INU mice resisted T1D, with none developing the disease. They had lower blood glucose, reduced pancreatic inflammation, and normalized serum insulin compared to STZ+SD mice. STZ+INU mice also had enhanced mucus production, abundant Bifidobacterium, Clostridium cluster IV, Akkermansia muciniphila, and increased fecal butyrate. In cecal lymph nodes, we observed fewer CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs expressing CCR4 and more Foxp3+CCR4+ cells in pancreatic islets, with higher CCL17 expression. This phenotype was absent in CCR4-deficient mice on inulin. Inulin supplementation effectively protects against experimental T1D by recruiting CCR4+ Treg cells via CCL17 into the pancreas and altering the butyrate-producing microbiota.",Gut microbiota;Immunoregulation;Inulin;Prebiotic;Regulatory T cells (Treg);Type 1 diabetes,diabetes

Optogenetics Sheds Light on Brown and Beige Adipocytes.,"Excessive food intake leads to lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue, triggering inflammation, cellular stress, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. In contrast, the dynamic energy expenditure and heat generation of brown and beige adipose tissue, driven by specialized mitochondria, render it an appealing candidate for therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing metabolic disorders. This review examines the therapeutic potential of brown and beige adipocytes for obesity and metabolic disorders, focusing on recent studies that employ optogenetics for thermogenesis control in these cells. The findings delve into the mechanisms underlying UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent thermogenesis and how optogenetic approaches can be used to precisely modulate energy expenditure and induce thermogenesis. The convergence of adipocyte biology and optogenetics presents an exciting frontier in combating metabolic disorders and advancing our understanding of cellular regulation and energy balance.",Beige adipocytes;Brown adipocytes;Calcium signaling;ChR2;Obesity;Optogenetics;Thermogenesis;Type 2 diabetes;UCP1;bPAC,diabetes
"Association rule mining of real-world data: Uncovering links between race, glycemic control, lipid profiles, and suicide attempts in individuals with diabetes.","The increased risk of suicide among individuals with diabetes is a significant public health concern. However, few studies have focused on understanding the relationship between suicide attempts and diabetes. Association rule mining (ARM) is a data mining technique to discover a set of high-risk factors of a given disease. Therefore, this study aimed to utilize ARM to identify a high-risk group of suicide attempts among patients with diabetes using Cerner Real-World Data™ (CRWD). The study analyzed a large multicenter electronic health records data of 3,265,041 patients with diabetes from 2010 to 2020. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression with ten-fold cross-validation and the Apriori algorithm with ARM were used to uncover groups of high-risk suicide attempts. Of the 52,217,517 unique patients in the CRWD, 3,266,856 were diagnosed with diabetes. There were 7764 (0.2%) patients with diabetes who had a history of suicide attempts. The study revealed that patients with diabetes who were never married and had average blood glucose levels below 150 mg/dl were more likely to attempt suicide. In contrast, patients with diabetes aged 60 and older who had diabetes for less than five years and A1C levels between 6.5 and 8.9% were less likely to attempt suicide. Risk factors were strongly associated with suicide attempts, including never married, White, blood glucose levels below 150 mg/dl, and LDL levels below 100 mg/dl. This is the first study utilizing ARM to discover the risk patterns for suicide attempts in individuals with diabetes. ARM showed the potential for knowledge discovery in large multi-center electronic health records data. The results are explainable and could be practically used by providers during outpatient clinic visits. Further studies are needed to validate the results and investigate the cause-and-effect relationship of suicide attempts among individuals with diabetes.",Association rule;Data mining;Diabetes;Risk pattern;Suicide attempts,diabetes
Case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy after surgical treatment of liver hydatid cyst: A case report.,"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also called apical ballooning syndrome, is a disease that is often triggered by stress factors in postmenopausal women and mimics acute coronary syndrome. The aim of this article is to draw attention to takotsubo cardiomyopathy after surgical treatment of liver hydatid cyst. A 50-year-old diabetic and hypertensive female patient was evaluated preoperatively before general surgery for liver hydatid cyst, and no cardiac problems were found. The patient was discharged on the 3rd postoperative day without any postoperative complications. On postoperative day 5, the patient presented to the emergency department with fever, shortness of breath, chills, and shivering and was hospitalized with the diagnosis of pneumonia. The troponin levels remained high during follow-up. Echocardiography was performed on postoperative day 7, after which the patient was referred to a tertiary center with the diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction due to akinesia in the apical region. Coronary angiography performed at the tertiary center showed normal coronary anatomy, and the patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy mimicking myocardial infarction without ST segment elevation may develop after surgical treatment of liver hydatid cyst.",Case report;Coronary angiography;Echocardiography;Liver hydatid cyst;Noncardiac surgery;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,diabetes
Radiation-induced Undifferentiated Malignant Pituitary Tumor After 5 Years of Treatment for Cushing Disease.,"The occurrence of a second neoplasm possibly constitutes an adverse and uncommon complication after radiotherapy. The incidence of a second pituitary tumor in patients irradiated for adrenocorticotropic hormone secreting pituitary adenoma is rare. We report a case of a 40-year-old female with Cushing disease who underwent surgical management followed by radiotherapy. After 5 years of initial treatment, an increase in tumor size was evident at the same location, with a significant interval growth of the parasellar component of the lesion. Histology revealed an undifferentiated highly malignant sarcoma. In the span of next 2 years, the patient was followed with 2 repeat decompression surgeries and radiotherapy because of significant recurrent compressive symptoms by locally invasive malignant tumor. Despite the best efforts, the patient remained unresponsive to multiple treatment strategies (eg, surgical resections and radiotherapy) and succumbed to death.",Cushing disease;radiotherapy;second malignancy,diabetes
Recovery of Therapeutically Ablated Engineered Blood-Vessel Networks on A Plug-And-Play Platform.,"Limiting the availability of key angiogenesis-promoting factors is a successful strategy to ablate tumor-supplying blood vessels or to reduce excessive vasculature in diabetic retinopathy. However, the efficacy of such anti-angiogenic therapies (AATs) varies with tumor type, and regrowth of vessels has been observed upon termination of treatment. Our ability to understand and develop AATs remains limited by a lack of robust in vitro systems for modeling the recovery of vascular networks. Here, we engineer complex three-dimensional micro-capillary networks by sequentially seeding human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on a previously established, synthetic plug-and-play hydrogel platform. In the tightly interconnected vascular networks that form this way, the two cell types share a basement membrane-like layer and can be maintained for several days of co-culture. Pre-formed networks degrade in the presence of bevacizumab. Upon treatment termination, vessel structures grow back in their original positions after replenishment with new endothelial cells, which also integrate into unperturbed established networks. Our data suggests that this plug-and-play platform enables the screening of drugs with blood-vessel inhibiting functions. We believe that this platform could be of particular interest in studying resistance or recovery mechanisms to AAT treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

Time to Benefit of Surgery vs. Targeted Medical Therapy for Patients with Primary Aldosteronism: A Meta-analysis.,"Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension, but the comparative outcomes of targeted treatment remain unclear. To compare the clinical outcomes in patients treated for primary aldosteronism over time. Medline and EMBASE. Original studies reporting incidence of mortality, major adverse cardiovascular outcomes (MACE), progression to chronic kidney disease, or diabetes following adrenalectomy versus medical therapy. 2 reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed study quality. Standard meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models to estimate relative differences. Time-to-benefit meta-analyses were conducted by fitting Weibull survival curves to estimate absolute risk differences and pooled using random-effects models. 15,541 patients (16 studies) with PA were included. Surgery was consistently associated with an overall lower risk of death (HR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.54]) and MACE (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.84]), compared to medical therapy. Surgery was associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.70]) and progression to chronic kidney disease (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.98]), and non-significant reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke. In absolute terms, 200 patients would need to be treated with surgery instead of medical therapy to prevent 1 death after 12.3 (95% CI, 3.1 to 48.7) months. Surgery is associated with lower all-cause mortality and MACE compared to medical therapy for primary aldosteronism.

Beta-blocker use and survival after pancreatic cancer surgery: A nationwide population-based cohort study.,"We examined the association between use of beta-blockers and survival in pancreatic cancer patients after curative-intent surgery. Using Danish healthcare registries, we conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for pancreatic cancer in Denmark 1997-2021. We defined beta-blocker use according to exposure before surgery as current (≤90 days), recent (91-365 days), or former (366-730 days) use, requiring at least one filled prescription. Patients were followed from the date of surgery for up to 5 years. We used Cox regression to compute hazard ratios (HRs) of deaths with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for age, sex, year of diagnosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver disease, alcohol, and smoking. We also conducted an active comparator analysis, where we used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers as comparators instead of nonusers. We included 2592 patients, of which 16.7% were beta-blocker users. Median survival for the entire population was 24.4 months. Beta-blocker use was associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.04-1.34). This was evident in current (adjusted HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.02-1.38) and recent (adjusted HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.04-1.59) but not former (adjusted HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.64-1.43) users. In the active comparator analysis, the association between beta-blocker exposure and mortality attenuated slightly (adjusted HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.93-1.35). We observed an association between beta-blocker use and increased mortality in patients operated for pancreatic cancer. Findings are likely explained by confounding by indication.",beta-blockers;epidemiology;pancreatic cancer;pharmacoepidemiology;prognosis;survival,diabetes
Bo's abdominal acupuncture improves disordered metabolism in obese type 2 diabetic rats through regulating fibroblast growth factor 21 and its related adipokines.,"To investigate the effect of Bo's abdominal acupuncture (BOAA) on fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and its related adipokines in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats. This study established obese T2DM rat model by high-fat diet (HFD) with a dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 30 mg/kg). Obese T2DM rats were randomly subdivided into four groups (n = 10): negative, BOAA, conventional acupuncture (COA group) and metformin group (Met group) groups. The biochemical parameters, mRNAs, and proteins were analyzed using enzyme-lined immunoassays kits, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Treatment with BOAA attenuated the histopathological changes in visceral fat and restored the alterations in the levels of body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). BOAA treatment significantly decreased the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, leptin, and increased the serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), adiponectin (ADP), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), C-peptide (C-P) in obese T2DM rats. Furthermore, BOAA treatment significantly increased the mRNA expressions of FGF21, ADP, leptin, PPAR-γ, PPAR-α and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Besides, BOAA treatment upregulated the protein expressions of fibroblast growth factor receptors3 (FGFR3), PPAR-α, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), AMPK, p-AMPK, Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), phosphorylated LKB1 (p-LKB1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and phosphorylated ACC (p-ACC), while downregulated the protein expressions of FGF21 and PPAR-γ in visceral fat. BOAA treatment reduced FBG and body weight, and improved insulin sensitivity through regulating FGF21 signaling pathway and its related adipokine in obese T2DM rats.","Bo's abdominal acupuncture;adipokines;diabetes mellitus, type 2;fibroblast growth factors;insulin resistance;obesity",diabetes
Dangua Fang regulating tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain and its mechanism in diabetic rats.,"To investigate the influence and possible targets of Dangua Fang on tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and respiratory chain to enrich the prescription's mechanism of effective intervention on glycolipid metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. After interventional rats were fed with high glucose and high fat diet ad libitum for 4 weeks, intraperitoneally injected streptozotocin to induce diabetic model. According to blood glucose level,28 diabetic rats were selected and continued to be fed with high glucose and high fat diet, were stratified by body weight, and divided randomly by blood glucose into Model group (was given sterile water by gastric perfusion and injected aquae pro injection intraperitoneally), Dangua group [Dangua liquor 20.5 g·kg-1·d-1 by perfusion and aquae pro injection intraperitoneally], Inhibitor group [sterile water by perfusion and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (Nampt) specific blocker GEN-617 1.25 mg/kg intraperitoneally], DanInhit group (Dangua liquor and GEN-617 synchronously). Control group were continuously fed with ordinary diet. The intervention was last for 10 weeks. Body weight (BW), liver index (LI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), TC, TG, free fatty acids (FFA), creatinine (Cr), and A-ketoglutarate (α-KG), Iso-citric acid (ICA), oxaloacetic acid (OAA) were tested. The cytochrome C oxidase (COX) and Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were evaluated by Colorimetry; Nampt protein, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase (ATPs), Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)and its reduced (NADH) in liver were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions of Nampt and mitochondrialnadhdehydrogenase-1 (mt-ND1) gene in liver was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hepatic tissue staining was also completed. The levels of BW, ICA, α-KG and Nampt-mRNA in the Model group are lower than that in the Normal group (P < 0.05), conversely, liver weight, LI, TC, HbA1c, SDH and ATPs, mt-ND1-mRNA, and Nampt protein in the Model group are higher (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Compared with Model group, the levels of ICA, Nampt-mRNA and Nampt in Dangua group are significantly increased, and FFA obviously raised (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05); liver weight, BW, SDH are obviously lower, and HbA1c decreased significantly (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). TG, FFA and Nampt protein increased in the DanInhit group, TC, TG, BW obviously increased in the Inhibitor group, but SDH is decreased in both the two groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with Dangua group, DanInhib group has the lower levels of ICA, mt-ND1-mRNA, Nampt-mRNA, and the higher level of BW, LI and HbA1c. In the Inhibitor group, ICA and Nampt protein decreased, BW and LI, HbA1c and TG increased (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Tissue staining display that, in the model group there is obvious pathologic changes ie: fibrosis, steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. Lesions in the Dangua group are mild, and those of Inhibitor group are more obvious than the Model group, and DanInhit group is intermediately affected compared to Dangua group and Inhibitor group.

Dark red tongue color formation caused by hyperglycemia is attributed to decreased blood flow of tongue tissue partially due to nuclear factor-kappa B pathway activation.,"To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the dark red tongue color formation induced by hyperglycemia. A high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin were used to establish a diabetes model. The color and blood flow of tongues were analyzed by the Tongue Diagnosis Analysis System and laser Doppler flowmetry, respectively. Inflammatory factors and adhesion factors were measured in the circulation and tongue tissue by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blotting was employed to evaluate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p50 and inhibitor of kappa B kinase protein expression levels in the tongue. Then, the NF-κB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid ammonium salt was utilized to repress NF-κB pathway activation to validate that the NF-κB pathway plays a key role in blood flow and dark red tongue color formation. The diabetic rats displayed a dark red tongue color that was accompanied by NF-κB pathway activation and decreased blood flow in the tongue. These effects could be reversed by the NF-κB inhibitor. Our investigation demonstrated that hyperglycemia led to dark red tongue color formation by decreasing blood flow in the tongue, which was partly due to NF-κB pathway activation.",NF-kappa B;blood circulation;hyperglycemia;tongue diagnosis;type 2 diabetes mellitus,diabetes
The role of continuous glucose monitoring in physical activity and nutrition management: perspectives on present and possible uses.,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is on the rise as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes increases. This review aimed to explore the use of CGM and its potential novel applications in physical activity and nutrition management. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library databases using the keywords 'continuous glucose monitor,' 'nutrition,' 'physical activity,' and 'numerical modeling.' Continuous blood glucose measurement is useful for individuals with obesity and diabetes. Long-term blood glucose data allow for personalized planning of nutritional composition, meal timing, and physical activity type and intensity, as well as help prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Thus, understanding the limitations of CGM is important for its effective use. CGM systems are being increasingly used to monitor and identify appropriate blood glucose controlling interventions. Blood glucose level is influenced by various factors such as nutrient composition, meal timing, physical activity, circadian rhythm, and cortisol levels. Numerical modeling can be used to analyze the complex relationship between stress, sleep, nutrition, and physical activity, which affect blood glucose levels. In future, blood glucose, sleep, and stress data will be integrated to predict appropriate lifestyle levels for blood glucose management. This integrated approach improves glucose control and overall wellbeing, potentially reducing societal costs.",blood glucose;continuous glucose monitoring;data;diabetes;numerical modeling;obesity,diabetes
Physical exercise-intervention can be valuable therapy for COVID-19 confinement and post-COVID-19 periods.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its transition into an endemic phase have profoundly impacted physical health, well-being, mental health, education, and various aspects of society, including the economy and social networks. Home confinement, social distancing, and physical inactivity have exacerbated numerous health issues, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, depression, and poor sleep quality. A systematic review has revealed significant findings: Regular aerobic programs (such as cycling or walking at an intensity of 60-80% of HR max for 20-60 minutes per session, repeated 2-3 times a week) have proven effective in improving both physical and mental health, as well as immune function. This type of physical activity has been shown to increase immunological markers, including lymphocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while reducing low-grade inflammation. Therefore, in this study we aimed to assess the impact of tailored exercise interventions on the physical and mental health of COVID-19 patients. Based on the results, we can establish exercise intervention strategies to mitigate the negative health consequences during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a search of the PubMed database from January 2020 to August 2023 using predefined search terms such as ""COVID-19 and post-COVID-19,"" ""exercise intervention and immunity,"" and ""mental health."" By examining references, we explored the links between exercise interventions and the mental and physical health of COVID-19 patients. A tailored, multifaceted exercise intervention should be developed and implemented to address the existing mental challenges and enhance mental health during both the pandemic and the post-COVID-19 periods. Breathing exercises and respiratory support techniques, including yoga, thoracic expansion exercises, airway clearance methods, and breathing control, are likely to be beneficial.",COVID-19;breathing exercise;mental health;physical activity;post-COVID-19 pandemic;valuable therapy,diabetes
Ketone-Based Alert System for Insulin Pump Failures.,"An increasing number of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) manage glycemia with insulin pumps containing short-acting insulin. If insulin delivery is interrupted for even a few hours due to pump or infusion site malfunction, the resulting insulin deficiency can rapidly initiate ketogenesis and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). To detect an event of accidental cessation of insulin delivery, we propose the design of ketone-based alert system (K-AS). This system relies on an extended Kalman filter based on plasma 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) measurements to estimate the disturbance acting on the insulin infusion/injection input. The alert system is based on a novel physiological model capable of simulating the ketone body turnover in response to a change in plasma insulin levels. Simulated plasma BOHB levels were compared with plasma BOHB levels available in the literature. We evaluated the performance of the K-AS on 10 in silico subjects using the S2014 UVA/Padova simulator for two different scenarios. The K-AS achieves an average detection time of 84 and 55.5 minutes in fasting and postprandial conditions, respectively, which compares favorably and improves against a detection time of 193 and 120 minutes, respectively, based on the current guidelines. The K-AS leverages the rapid rate of increase of plasma BOHB to achieve short detection time in order to prevent BOHB levels from rising to dangerous levels, without any false-positive alarms. Moreover, the proposed novel insulin-BOHB model will allow us to understand the efficacy of treatment without compromising patient safety.",Kalman filter;ketone measurement;pump failure;type 1 diabetes,diabetes
Predicting the Risk of Developing Type 1 Diabetes Using a One-Week Continuous Glucose Monitoring Home Test With Classification Enhanced by Machine-Learning: An Exploratory Study.,"Detection of two or more autoantibodies (Ab) in the blood might describe those individuals at increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1D) during the following years. The aim of this exploratory study is to propose a high versus low T1D risk classifier using machine-learning technology based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) home data. Forty-two healthy relatives of people with T1D with mean ± SD age of 23.8 ± 10.5 years, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) of 5.3% ± 0.3%, and BMI (body mass index) of 23.2 ± 5.2 kg/m2 with zero (low risk; N = 21), and ≥2 (high risk; N = 21) Ab, were enrolled in an NIH (National Institutes of Health)-funded TrialNet ancillary study. Participants wore a CGM for a week and consumed three standardized liquid mixed meals (SLMM) instead of three breakfasts. Glycemic features were extracted from two-hour post-SLMM CGM traces, compared across groups, and used in four supervised machine-learning Ab risk status classifiers. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm was used for feature selection; classifiers were evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation, using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC-ROC) to select the best classification model. The percent time of glucose >180 mg/dL (T180), glucose range, and glucose CV (coefficient of variation) were the only significant differences between the glycemic features in the two groups with P values of .040, .035, and .028 respectively. The linear SVM (Support Vector Machine) model with RFE features achieved the best performance of classifying low-risk versus high-risk individuals with AUC-ROC = 0.88. A machine-learning technology, combining a potentially self-administered one-week CGM home test, has the potential to reliably assess the T1D risk.",continuous glucose monitoring;islet autoantibodies;machine-learning;prediabetes;type 1 diabetes,diabetes
Risk of Tendon Injury in Patients Treated With Fluoroquinolone (FQ) Versus Non-Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).,"Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are associated with increased risk of tendon injury but comparative risk versus other antibiotic options for the same indication has yet to be evaluated. Describe the incidence (relative risk) of any tendon injury in patients receiving FQ compared with other (non-FQs) antibiotics for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A retrospective propensity score weighted cohort study was performed to evaluate the association between FQ antibiotics and tendon injury risk at 2 time points (within 1 month and within 6 months of use) compared with non-FQ regimens for treatment of CAP. The evaluation was performed using the CCAE (MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters) and COB (Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits) databases from 2014 to 2020. Patients with ICD (International Classification of Diseases) 9/10 coding for outpatient pneumonia who were >18 years and without history of tendon injury were included. Patients with history of tendon injury, who received multiple antibiotic therapies for recurrent pneumonia, or who received both FQ and non-FQ regimens during the study period were excluded. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for selection bias due to contributing risk factors, including demographics (age, sex), comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease), and concurrent medications (corticosteroids). At 1 month, the odds of tendon injury were estimated to be significantly higher (41.9%) in patients receiving FQs compared with those receiving a non-FQ-based regimen (odds ratio [OR] = 1.419, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.188-1.698]). The odds of tendon injury were also estimated to be higher (OR = 1.067, 95% CI = [0.975-1.173]) in the FQ population within 180 days, but this effect was not statistically significant. The most frequent sites of tendon injuries were rotator cuff, shoulder, and patellar tendon. Prescribers should recognize the risk of tendon injury within 1 month of FQ use when considering treatment regimens for CAP and use alternative options with lower risk whenever possible.",community-acquired pneumonia;fluoroquinolone;tendon injury,diabetes
Phytochemicals and Their Potential Mechanisms Against Insulin Resistance.,"Insulin's inception dates back to 1921 and was unveiled through a momentous revelation. Diabetes is a dangerous, long-term disease in which the body fails to generate enough insulin or utilize the insulin it creates adequately. This causes hyperglycemia, a state of high blood sugar levels, which can even put a person into a coma if not managed. Activation of the insulin receptor corresponds to two crucial metabolic functions, i.e., uptake of glucose and storage of glycogen. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exists as one of the most challenging medical conditions in the 21st century. The sedentary lifestyle and declining quality of food products have contributed to the rapid development of metabolic disorders. Hence, there is an urgent need to lay some reliable, significant molecules and modalities of treatment to combat and manage this epidemic. In this review, we have made an attempt to identify and enlist the major phytoconstituents along with the associated sources and existing mechanisms against insulin resistance. The conducted study may offer potential sustainable solutions for developing and formulating scientifically validated molecules and phytoconstituents as formulations for the management of this metabolic disorder.",Diabetes;Type 2 diabetes mellitus;glycogen;insulin;phytoconstituents,diabetes
"Optimization of Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering in Endocrine, Metabolic and Immune Disorders.","Approximately 50% of the adult global population is projected to suffer from some form of metabolic disease by 2050, including metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. At the same time, this trend indicates a potential increase in the number of patients who will be in need of implant-supported reconstructions of specific bone regions subjected to inflammatory states. Moreover, physiological conditions associated with dysmetabolic subjects have been suggested to contribute to the severity of bone loss after bone implant insertion. However, there is a perspective evidence strengthening the hypothesis that custom-fabricated bioengineered scaffolds may produce favorable bone healing effects in case of altered endocrine or metabolic conditions. This perspective review aims to share a comprehensive knowledge of the mechanisms implicated in bone resorption and remodelling processes, which have driven researchers to develop metallic implants as the cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) bioscaffolds, presenting optimized geometries that interact in an effective way with the osteogenetic precursor cells, especially in the cases of perturbed endocrine or metabolic conditions.",3D-printed scaffolds;cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) bioscaffolds;customized medicine;endocrine metabolic and immune disorders;regenerative medicine;tissue engineering;translational medicine.,diabetes
Assessing the Frequency of COVID-19 in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI).,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global health crisis with significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial infarction and identify associated demographic and clinical characteristics. In this study, a retrospective and descriptive cross-sectional design was used to examine all patients (a total of 85) who experienced acute myocardial infarction and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The study measured various parameters, such as COVID-19 status, age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes, and hypertension. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25 software. Out of the 85 patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial infarction (MI), 14 patients (16.5%) were found to have COVID-19. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed through RT-PCR testing for 2 patients, while the remaining 12 patients were diagnosed using lung CT scans. Among the COVID-19 patients, 21.4% (n = 3) had background diabetes, and 7.1% (n = 1) had background hypertension. MI recurrence was observed in 14.3% of COVID-19 patients (2 cases). Unfortunately, 1 COVID-19 patient, a 70- year-old Persian woman with diabetes and hypertension, passed away. No significant differences were found in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, underlying diabetes, or underlying hypertension between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. The high occurrence of COVID-19 among myocardial infarction (MI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is worth noting. Further investigation is recommended to explore the impact of demographic and contextual factors on the severity and outcomes of primary PCI in MI patients with COVID-19, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved.",COVID-19;Diabetes;MI;PCI;acute respiratory syndrome.;cardiovascular disease,diabetes

The association between pro-vegetarian dietary pattern and risk of colorectal cancer: a matched case-control study.,"Few studies assess the link between plant-based diets and colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. To our knowledge, no study has examined the association between pro-vegetarian dietary pattern (PDP) and CRC globally or among Iranians. Therefore, the objective of our matched case-control study was to evaluate the association between PDP and CRC in the Iranian population. The present research was a hospital-based case (n = 71)-control (n = 142) study conducted in the same hospitals in Tehran, Iran. This study used a reliable and valid semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire to evaluate the participants' dietary intake. According to the residual method, the selected plant and animal foods have been adjusted in the total energy intake to calculate the PDP index. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for confounding variables were also expressed using logistic regression by SPSS software. In the crude and adjusted models, we observed that the odds of CRC decreased significantly in the 3rd and last quartile of PDP compared to the 1st quartile (Q) (Crude model: Q3: OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.17 - 0.79, P-value = 0.011 and Q4: OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.14 - 0.79, P-value = 0.012 - Adjusted model: Q3: OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.94, P-value = 0.035 and Q4: OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14 - 0.87, P-value = 0.025). Based on the results of the present case-control study in the Iranian population, it was concluded that PDP, which involves consuming vegetables, fruits, cereals, dairy products, and low meat consumption, reduces the odds of CRC. In conclusion, adherence to PDP is associated with a decreased odds of CRC.",Colorectal Neoplasms;Colorectal cancer;Iranian;Pro-vegetarian dietary pattern,diabetes
"Effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei supplementation on the single-cell fecal parasitome in children with celiac disease autoimmunity: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.","Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HEAL9 and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei 8700:2 positively affect the fecal bacteriome in children with celiac disease autoimmunity after 6 months of supplementation. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HEAL9 and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei 8700:2 on the single-cell parasitome, with a primary focus on Blastocystis. Stool samples were collected from 78 Swedish children with celiac disease autoimmunity participating in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to either receive a mixture of supplementation with L. plantarum HEAL9 and L. paracasei 8700:2 (n = 38) or placebo (n = 40). A total of 227 stool samples collected at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of intervention, respectively, were retrospectively analyzed for Blastocystis by quantitative real-time PCR and subtyped by massively parallel amplicon sequencing. Other single-cell parasites were detected by untargeted 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing and verified by real-time PCR. The relation between the parasites and the bacteriome community was characterized by using 16S rDNA profiling of the V3-V4 region. Three different single-cell protists were identified, of which the highest prevalence was found for Dientamoeba fragilis (23.1%, 18/78 children), followed by Blastocystis (15.4%, 12/78) and Entamoeba spp. (2.6%, 2/78). The quantity of the protists was stable over time and not affected by probiotic intervention (P = 0.14 for Blastocystis, P = 0.10 for D. fragilis). The positivity of the protists was associated with increased bacteriome diversity (measured by multiple indices, P < 0.03). Bacterial composition was influenced by the presence of the protists: positivity of Blastocystis was inversely associated with Akkermansia (at the levels of the genus as well as its family, order, class and phylum); P < 0.002), Faecalibacterium (P = 0.003) and Romboutsia (P = 0.029); positivity of D. fragilis was inversely associated with families Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.016) and Coriobacteriaceae (P = 0.022) and genera Flavonifractor (P < 0.001), Faecalibacterium (P = 0.009), Lachnoclostridium (P = 0.029), Ruminococcus (P < 0.001) and Granulicatella (P = 0.018). The prevalence of single-cell protists is low in children with celiac disease autoimmunity. The colonization was stable regardless of the probiotic intervention and associated with increased diversity of the fecal bacteriome but inversely associated with some beneficial bacteria.",Blastocystis;Celiac disease;Dientamoeba fragilis;Gut microbiome;Probiotics,diabetes
The risk factors of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy: an updated meta-analysis.,"The purpose of the current meta-analysis was to determine the incidence and risk factors to provide a scientific basis for prevention and treatment of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Relevant articles published before October 2022 were searched from Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane and Embase databases. The outcomes were the incidence and risk factors for POCD. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the overall odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) for all risk factors through STATA 14.0 and RevMan 5.4. The quality of eligible studies was evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) as previously described. A total of 22 articles involving 3459 CEA patients were finally identified. The weighted mean incidence of POCD was 19% (95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 0.16-0.24, P < 0.001). Of the 16 identified risk factors, hyperperfusion (OR: 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71) and degree of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (OR: 5.06, 95% CI 0.86-9.27) were the potential risk factors of POCD, whereas patients taking statins preoperative had a lower risk of POCD (OR: 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71). Subgroup analysis revealed that the risk of POCD at 1 month after CEA was higher in patients with diabetes (OR: 1.70, 95% CI 1.07-2.71). The risk factors of POCD were hyperperfusion and degree of ICA stenosis, while diabetes could significantly increase the incidence of POCD at 1 month after surgery. Additionally, preoperative statin use could be a protective factor for POCD following CEA.",Carotid endarterectomy;Meta-analysis;Postoperative cognitive dysfunction;Risk factor,diabetes
Enhancing open clinical trials through blinded evaluations: an exploration with diabetic foot infections.,"Blinding drugs through simulation techniques is an important means to control the subjective bias of investigators and subjects. However, clinical trials face significant challenges in the placebo production of drugs, and many trials cannot be double-blinded. This study was conducted to ascertain the consistency between non-blind and blind evaluation results in clinical trials and to pioneer strategies to control information bias, particularly in trials where double-blinding is not feasible. In this investigation, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) studying diabetic foot infections (DFIs) was utilized as a representative case. In this trial, the grading of DFIs, as per guidelines by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and International Working Group on Diabetic Foot (IWGDF), was used as the primary efficacy indicator. A sample of sixteen patients was randomly chosen from the RCT, and DFI grading was assessed jointly by both non-blinded investigators and blinded center-reading investigators. A consistency test was then deployed to compare the evaluation results, forming the basis for our proposed strategies for effective blinded evaluation. In addition, other perspectives were collected at the end of this study, including with those involved in designing and conducting the recent blinded evaluation trial. Five subjects were excluded due to the quality of photos or the lack of post-treatment visits. The post-treatment IDSA/IWGDF grading results were compared in 11 subjects (experimental group=6, control group=5), and the consistency test showed inconsistent results between the non-blinded and center reading blinded evaluations (Kappa=0.248, p=0.384). In the experimental group, three cases were judged as grade 1 in the non-blinded evaluation and grade 2 in the central reading blinded evaluation; in the control group, three cases were judged as grade 2 in the non-blinded evaluation and grade 1 in the central reading blinded evaluation. The sum of these two cases in 22 post-treatment determinations was 27% (6/22). Furthermore, researchers propose several strategies for implementing blinded evaluations in clinical trials after this trial, which encompass aspects such as staff allocation, training, participant management, trial drug administration, efficacy indicator collection, and safety event management. The study highlighted that evaluations from non-blinded site investigators may potentially exaggerate the efficacy of the experimental group and that deep wounds can present challenges for observation via center-reading photos. These findings underline the vital necessity for objective assessment in open clinical trials, especially those where wound observation serves as the primary efficacy indicator. The study suggests the adoption of independent blinded investigators at each site, complemented by a comprehensive set of standard operating procedures for blinding evaluation. These measures could serve as an effective counterbalance to subjective bias, thereby augmenting the credibility and consistency of results in open clinical trials. The implications of these findings and recommendations could be of great significance for the design and execution of future open clinical trials, potentially bolstering the quality of clinical research in this area.

Cardiometabolic comorbidities in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a 16-year retrospective cohort study.,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent hereditary kidney disease and the fourth leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Nevertheless, there is a paucity of epidemiological research examining the risk factors and survival on RRT for ADPKD. Thus, we aimed to investigate the cumulative effects of cardiometabolic comorbidities, including hypertension (HTN), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidemia (DLP) to clinical outcomes in ADPKD. We identified 6,142 patients with ADPKD aged ≥ 20 years from 2000 to 2015 using a nationwide population-based database. HTN, DM, and DLP diagnoses before or at the time of ADPKD diagnosis and different combinations of the three diagnoses were used as the predictors for the outcomes. Survival analyses were used to estimate the adjusted mortality risk from cardiometabolic comorbidities and the risk for renal survival. Patients with ADPKD who developed ESRD had the higher all-cause mortality (HR, 5.14; [95% CI: 3.88-6.80]). Patients with all three of the diseases had a significantly higher risk of entering ESRD (HR:4.15, [95% CI:3.27-5.27]), followed by those with HTN and DM (HR:3.62, [95% CI:2.82-4.65]), HTN and DLP (HR:3.54, [95% CI:2.91-4.31]), and HTN alone (HR:3.10, [95% CI:2.62-3.66]) compared with those without any three cardiometabolic comorbidities. Our study discovered the cumulative effect of HTN, DM, and DLP on the risk of developing ESRD, which reinforces the urgency of proactive prevention of cardiometabolic comorbidities to improve renal outcomes and overall survival in ADPKD patients.",ADPKD;All-cause mortality;Cardiometabolic comorbidities;ESRD;Renal replacement therapy,diabetes
"Prevalence, patterns and associated risk factors for dyslipidaemia among individuals attending the diabetes clinic at a tertiary hospital in Central Malawi.","Dyslipidaemia among individuals with diabetes is a significant modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs). ASCVDs are a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally, especially in people with diabetes. In Malawi, limited data exist on the prevalence and biochemical characteristics of diabetic dyslipidaemia. This study investigated the prevalence and biochemical characteristics of dyslipidaemia in individuals attending the diabetes clinic at Kamuzu Central Hospital, the largest tertiary referral hospital in Central Malawi. Using a cross-sectional design, sociodemographic, medical and anthropometric data were collected from 391 adult participants who were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were analysed for glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c) and fasting lipid profiles. The prevalence of dyslipidaemia was calculated, and the biochemical characteristics of the dyslipidaemia were defined. The associations between dyslipidaemia and risk factors such as sociodemographic characteristics, obesity, and HBA1c levels were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Prevalence of dyslipidaemia was observed in 71% of the participants, and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was the most frequent lipid abnormality among the study participants. None of the participants were receiving any lipid-lowering therapy. On bivariate analysis, dyslipidemia was positively associated with female sex [OR 1.65 (95% CI 1.05- 2.58); p = 0.09], age ≥ 30 years [OR 3.60 (95% CI 1.17-7.68); p = 0.001] and overweight and obesity [OR 2.11 (95% CI 1.33-3.34); p = 0.002]. On multivariate analysis, being overweight or obese was an independent predictor of dyslipidaemia [AOR 1.8;(95% CI 1.15- 3.37); p = 0.04]. Dyslipidaemia was highly prevalent among individuals with diabetes in this study, and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was the most frequent lipid abnormality. Overweight and obesity were also highly prevalent and positively predicted dyslipidaemia. This study highlights the importance of appropriately addressing dyslipidaemia, overweight and obesity among individuals with diabetes in Malawi and other similar settings in Africa as one of the significant ways of reducing the risk of ASCVDs among this population.",Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;Diabetes mellitus;Dyslipidaemia;Kamuzu central hospital;Malawi,diabetes
Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide regulates body weight and food intake via GABAergic neurons in mice.,"The development of single-molecule co-agonists for the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor (GIPR) is considered a breakthrough in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. But although GIPR-GLP-1R co-agonism decreases body weight with superior efficacy relative to GLP-1R agonism alone in preclinical1-3 and clinical studies4,5, the role of GIP in regulating energy metabolism remains enigmatic. Increasing evidence suggests that long-acting GIPR agonists act in the brain to decrease body weight through the inhibition of food intake3,6-8; however, the mechanisms and neuronal populations through which GIP affects metabolism remain to be identified. Here, we report that long-acting GIPR agonists and GIPR-GLP-1R co-agonists decrease body weight and food intake via inhibitory GABAergic neurons. We show that acyl-GIP decreases body weight and food intake in male diet-induced obese wild-type mice, but not in mice with deletion of Gipr in Vgat(also known as Slc32a1)-expressing GABAergic neurons (Vgat-Gipr knockout). Whereas the GIPR-GLP-1R co-agonist MAR709 leads, in male diet-induced obese wild-type mice, to greater weight loss and further inhibition of food intake relative to a pharmacokinetically matched acyl-GLP-1 control, this superiority over GLP-1 vanishes in Vgat-Gipr knockout mice. Our data demonstrate that long-acting GIPR agonists crucially depend on GIPR signaling in inhibitory GABAergic neurons to decrease body weight and food intake.",,diabetes
Maternal and neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with a higher risk of adverse maternal outcomes, but its effects on maternal and perinatal outcomes of twin pregnancies remain conflicting. This retrospective cohort study included all primipara who delivered twin pregnancies at a single tertiary perinatal center between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2022. Excluded were those who had a single pregnancy, twin pregnancies with pre-existing diabetes, missing information on GDM screening, a delivery before gestational 28 weeks, complications related to monochorionic placentation, multifetal reduction, fetal anomalies, and monochorionic monoamniotic twins. Maternal outcomes included preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, hypothyroidism, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM), placental abruption, severe postpartum hemorrhage, and oligohydramnios. Neonatal outcomes included small-for-gestational-age (SGA), large-for-gestational-age (LGA), birthweight, Apgar score, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR), and neonatal hypoglycemia. A total of 3269 twins were delivered, with 897 women (27.4%) diagnosed with GDM during pregnancies; moreover, 72 (8.0%) of these women received insulin treatment. The GDM group showed a significantly higher maternal age at delivery (≥35 years), as well as incidences of overweight and obesity. These factors also elevated the odds of insulin treatment in GDM women with twin pregnancies (OR = 1.881, 95% CI = 1.073-3.295, P = 0.027; OR = 2.450, 95% CI = 1.422-4.223, P < 0.001; OR = 4.056, 95% CI = 1.728-9.522, P < 0.001, respectively). Chronic hypertension prior to pregnancy was identified as a risk factor for GDM during twin pregnancies (OR = 1.896, 95% CI = 1.290-2.785, P < 0.001), although it did not increase the proportion of women requiring insulin treatment (P = 0.808). Aside from a higher incidence of preterm birth before 37 weeks in insulin-treated GDM twins (OR = 2.096, 95% CI = 1.017-4.321, P = 0.045), there were no significant difference in other maternal outcomes (preterm birth before 34 weeks, pre-eclampsia, hypothyroidism, PROM, placental abruption, placenta previa, severe postpartum hemorrhage, and oligohydramnios) between the GDM group and non-GDM group, and between insulin-treated GDM and non-insulin-treated GDM. The rate of newborns with birthweight <1500 g was significantly lower among twins born to GDM women, but the prevalence of EUGR was notably higher. Additionally, the risk of EUGR was elevated in insulin-treated GDM twins (OR = 3.170, 95% CI = 1.639,6.131, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the GDM group and non-GDM group, or between insulin-treated GDM and non-insulin-treated GDM group in terms of mean birthweight, newborn sex ratio, and incidences of other adverse neonatal outcomes, including gestational age at delivery, LGA, birth weight <2500 g, and 1-min and 5-min Apgar scores. Maternal age ≥35 years, overweight or obesity, and chronic hypertension are significant risk factors for GDM during twin pregnancies. Women with GDM during twin pregnancies may achieve similar outcomes compared to those without GDM. However, the women with GDM during twin pregnancies receiving insulin therapy may have a higher risk of preterm birth and EUGR.",GDM;Insulin;Preterm birth;Twin pregnancy,diabetes
Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c.,"Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are both used to diagnose diabetes, but these measurements can identify different people as having diabetes. We used data from 117 population-based studies and quantified, in different world regions, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, and whether those who were previously undiagnosed and detected as having diabetes in survey screening, had elevated FPG, HbA1c or both. We developed prediction equations for estimating the probability that a person without previously diagnosed diabetes, and at a specific level of FPG, had elevated HbA1c, and vice versa. The age-standardized proportion of diabetes that was previously undiagnosed and detected in survey screening ranged from 30% in the high-income western region to 66% in south Asia. Among those with screen-detected diabetes with either test, the age-standardized proportion who had elevated levels of both FPG and HbA1c was 29-39% across regions; the remainder had discordant elevation of FPG or HbA1c. In most low- and middle-income regions, isolated elevated HbA1c was more common than isolated elevated FPG. In these regions, the use of FPG alone may delay diabetes diagnosis and underestimate diabetes prevalence. Our prediction equations help allocate finite resources for measuring HbA1c to reduce the global shortfall in diabetes diagnosis and surveillance.",,diabetes
Real-world clinical characteristics of post-essential thrombocythemia and post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis.,"There are few prospective studies on patients with post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF) and post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF). Therefore, we conducted a nationwide longitudinal prospective survey to clarify the clinical characteristics of these diseases. A total of 197 PET-MF and 117 PPV-MF patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2021 were analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 70.0 years for both diseases. The time from diagnosis of ET or PV to that of MF was 9.6 and 10.4 years, respectively, with no significant difference. Patients with PPV-MF had higher hemoglobin levels and white blood cell counts than those with PET-MF, whereas those with PET-MF had higher platelet counts than those with PPV-MF. Although splenomegaly was more frequent in patients with PPV-MF at diagnosis, there was no difference in the frequency of constitutional symptoms. Ruxolitinib was the most common treatment administered to 74.6% and 83.8% of patients with PET-MF and PPV-MF, respectively. Patients with PET-MF and PPV-MF had similar prognoses, with 3-year overall survival (OS) of 0.742 in PET-MF and 0.768 in PPV-MF patients. In both diseases, leukemic transformation was the leading cause of death, followed by infection. The 3-year OS for patients with PET/PPV-MF and primary MF diagnosed during the same period was 0.754 and 0.626, respectively, with no significant difference. This survey provides real-world clinical features and prognostic data on secondary myelofibrosis in the ruxolitinib era.",Post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis;Post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis;Primary myelofibrosis;Ruxolitinib,diabetes
Moderation of associations between weight discrimination and diabetes status by psychosocial factors.,"Weight discrimination has adverse effects on health that include increasing the risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Preliminary evidence suggests a positive association between weight discrimination and diagnosed diabetes; however, it is unknown whether psychosocial resources may buffer this association. In logistic regressions stratified by gender, we examined links between weight discrimination and diabetes among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project; N = 2,794 adults age 50 and older in 2015-16). We also tested the extent to which trait-resilience and social support from a spouse/partner, family, and friends buffered any observed association. We adjusted for known predictors of diabetes (age, race/ethnicity, Body Mass Index) and conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to men and women with obesity. Net of covariates, in the overall sample, weight discrimination was associated with significantly greater odds of having ever had diabetes among women (OR = 2.00, 95% CI [1.15, 3.47]), but not men. Among women with obesity, weight discrimination was only significantly associated with greater odds of diabetes for those with low resilience (OR = 1.84, 95% CI [1.01, 3.35]). Among men overall, weight discrimination was associated with lower odds of diabetes for those with high family support (OR = 0.03, 95% CI [0.003, 0.25]) as well as those with high friend support (OR = 0.34, 95% CI [0.13, 0.91]); similar effects were observed in men with obesity. These novel findings evince a role for psychosocial resources in buffering associations between weight discrimination and diabetes.",Obesity;Resilience;Social support;Stigma;Type 2 Diabetes;Weight discrimination,diabetes
OAGB Bowel Function in Patients With up to 5 Years Follow-Up: Updated Outcomes.,"One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is considered an effective technique in weight reduction and remission of comorbidities. However, in common with many bariatric and metabolic/bariatric procedures, gastrointestinal side effects are frequently reported, but clinical experience varies. The objective of this study was to analyze the bowel function of patients who undergo OAGB looking at 5-year postoperative outcomes. This study is cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical, developed with individuals undergoing OAGB (n = 208) in yhe period between 2015 and 2020. The time periods evaluated were 1 to 6 months (T1), 6 to 12 months (T2), and 1 to 5 years (T3). Data analysis was performed using SPSS v.28.0, considering a significance level p ≤ 0.05. 114 participants (54.8%), 79.8% women, mean age 47.0 ± 12.6 years, and BMI 40.1 ± 5.6 kg/m2, 51.9% dyslipidemia, 43.6% arterial hypertension, and 19.1% diabetes mellitus. The T1 group had more severe symptoms/nausea than the T2 group. The T2 group had a significantly lower defecation frequency than the T1 and T3 groups. As for the occurrence of diarrhea, associations were not found in the considered groups. The T3 group had a greater severity of constipation associated with greater difficulty in consuming red meat, white meat, rice, vegetables, and salads. Gastrointestinal symptoms are prevalent in the first postoperative months. However, diarrhea was not common. The patient selection policy and surgical technique were decisive in this result. Constipation was prevalent in patients between 1 and 5 postoperative years. It was also prevalent in those who had food intolerance, which from a nutritional point of view is an adverse factor for optimal bowel function.",Bariatric surgery;Bowel function;Metabolic surgery;Mini gastric bypass;Nutrition;One anastomosis gastric bypass,diabetes

Estimated glomerular filtration rate and the risk of stroke in individuals with diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation insight from a large contemporary population study.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased risk of embolic complications in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Impaired renal function (IRF) increases the risk of stroke as well, but this finding is not consistent among all studies. Our aim was to assess the incidence rates and risk of ischemic stroke and mortality by baseline Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) levels Among individuals with AF and DM. A prospective, historical cohort study using the Clalit Health Services electronic medical records database. Among patients with AF and DM, we compared three groups according to eGFR levels: eGFR ≥ 60, between 30 and 60, and ≤ 30 (mL/min/1.73m2). A total of 17,567 cases were included in the final analysis; of them, 11,013 (62.7%) had eGFR ≥ 60, 4930 (28%) had eGFR between 30 and 60, and 1624 (9.24%) with eGFR ≤ 30. The incidence of stroke per 100 person-years in the three study groups was: 1.88, 2.69, and 3.34, respectively (p < 0.001).

In this study, we screened the risk factors for the development of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis by univariate analysis, LASSO regression and multifactor analysis, then established a nomogram model for predicting the risk of getting hepatic encephalopathy for patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and finally performed differentiation analysis, calibration analysis, clinical decision curve analysis and validation of the established model. A total of 1178 patients with decompensated cirrhosis who were hospitalized and treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine between January 2016 and June 2022 were included for modeling and validation. Based on the results of univariate analysis, LASSO regression analysis and multifactor analysis, a final nomogram model with age, diabetes, ascites, spontaneous peritonitis, alanine transaminase, and blood potassium as predictors of hepatic encephalopathy risk prediction was created. The results of model differentiation analysis showed that the AUC of the model of the training set was 0.738 (95% CI 0.63-0.746), while the AUC of the model of the validation set was 0.667 (95% CI 0.541-0.706), and the two AUCs indicated a good discrimination of this nomogram model. According to the Cut-Off value determined by the Jorden index, when the Cut-Off value of the training set was set at 0.150, the sensitivity of the model was 72.8%, the specificity was 64.8%, the positive predictive value was 30.4%, and the negative predictive value was 91.9%; when the Cut-Off value of the validation set was set at 0.141, the sensitivity of the model was 69.7%, the specificity was 57.3%, the positive predictive value was 34.5%, and the negative predictive value was 84.7%. The calibration curve and the actual events curve largely overlap at the diagonal, indicating that the prediction with this model has less error. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test for goodness of fit was also applied, and the results showed that for the training set, χ2 = 1.237587, P = 0.998, and for the validation set, χ2 = 31.90904, P = 0.0202, indicating that there was no significant difference between the predicted and actual observed values. The results of the clinical decision curve analysis showed that the model had a good clinical benefit, compared with the two extreme clinical scenarios (all patients treated or none treated), and the model also had a good clinical benefit in the validation set. This study showed that aged over 55 years, complications of diabetes, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, abnormal glutamate aminotransferase and abnormal blood potassium are independent risks indicators for the development of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The nomogram model based on the indicators mentioned above can effectively and conveniently predict the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The nomogram model established on this study can help clinical healthcare professionals to timely and early identify patients with high risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.",,diabetes
Checkpoint kinase 2 controls insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.,"After the discovery of insulin, a century ago, extensive work has been done to unravel the molecular network regulating insulin secretion. Here we performed a chemical screen and identified AZD7762, a compound that potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) of a human β cell line, healthy and type 2 diabetic (T2D) human islets and primary cynomolgus macaque islets. In vivo studies in diabetic mouse models and cynomolgus macaques demonstrated that AZD7762 enhances GSIS and improves glucose tolerance. Furthermore, genetic manipulation confirmed that ablation of CHEK2 in human β cells results in increased insulin secretion. Consistently, high-fat-diet-fed Chk2-/- mice show elevated insulin secretion and improved glucose clearance. Finally, untargeted metabolic profiling demonstrated the key role of the CHEK2-PP2A-PLK1-G6PD-PPP pathway in insulin secretion. This study successfully identifies a previously unknown insulin secretion regulating pathway that is conserved across rodents, cynomolgus macaques and human β cells in both healthy and T2D conditions.",,diabetes
Opportunistic health screening for cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors in primary care dental practices: experiences from a service evaluation and a call to action.,"Introduction Substantial evidence has established associations between oral health and chronic diseases, mediated by common risk factors and inflammatory processes. Dental professionals are aptly positioned to screen for cardiovascular disease and diabetes high-risk indicators. This article presents a service evaluation of two dental practices delivering health screening in dental practice, and a call to action for the wider profession.Methods Following training, two general dental practices implemented a suite of health screens, including blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio. A service evaluation was undertaken to review and improve service provision.Results Most patients (78.4%) had blood pressure values above normal range. More than half (55.8%) were outside of the healthy range for BMI. Out-of-range results for cholesterol were observed in less than one-fifth (16.7%). High blood glucose values were observed for few patients (3.3%).Conclusion Dental professionals can be successfully trained to deliver health screening interventions. Out-of-range health screening results offer an opportunity to provide targeted health advice for both the oral and general health. Clear protocols and careful interpretation of screening tests are required to minimise patients' confusion. More robust alliances between dental and general medical care are recommended.",,diabetes

"Novel vanadyl complexes synthesis, characterization and interactions with bovine serum albumin-effects on STZ- diabetes rats.","Drug-protein interactions are essential since most administered drugs bind abundantly and reversibly to serum albumin and are delivered mainly as a complex with protein. The nature and strength of drug-protein interactions have a big impact on how a drug works biologically. The binding parameters are useful in studying the pharmacological response of drugs and the designing of dosage forms. Serum albumin is regarded as optimal model for in vitro research on drug-protein interaction since it is the main protein that binds medicines and other physiological components. In this perspective, binary complex have been synthesized and characterized, from vanadium metal and acetylacetone(4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-theonyl)-1,3-butanedione). Imidazole, 2-Methyl-imidazole, and 2-Ethyl-imidazole auxiliary ligands were employed for the synthesis of ternary complexes. Additionally, UV absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were used to examine the binding interactions between vanadium complexes and Bovine Serum Albumin. The outcomes of the binding studies and spectral approaches were in strong agreement with one another. These complexes upon inoculation into diabetes-induced Wistar rats stabilized their serum glucose levels within 3 days. From various studies, it was discovered that the ordering of glucose-lowering actions of these metal complexes were equivalent. The vanadium ternary metal complex derived from (4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-theonyl)-1,3-butanedione) and imidazole as ligands is the best among the other metal vanadium complexes.",BSA;Drug-protein interactions;Serum glucose;Vanadium complex,diabetes
Optogenetic stimulation of vagal nerves for enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and β cell proliferation.,"The enhancement of insulin secretion and of the proliferation of pancreatic β cells are promising therapeutic options for diabetes. Signals from the vagal nerve regulate both processes, yet the effectiveness of stimulating the nerve is unclear, owing to a lack of techniques for doing it so selectively and prolongedly. Here we report two optogenetic methods for vagal-nerve stimulation that led to enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and to β cell proliferation in mice expressing choline acetyltransferase-channelrhodopsin 2. One method involves subdiaphragmatic implantation of an optical fibre for the photostimulation of cholinergic neurons expressing a blue-light-sensitive opsin. The other method, which suppressed streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemia in the mice, involves the selective activation of vagal fibres by placing blue-light-emitting lanthanide microparticles in the pancreatic ducts of opsin-expressing mice, followed by near-infrared illumination. The two methods show that signals from the vagal nerve, especially from nerve fibres innervating the pancreas, are sufficient to regulate insulin secretion and β cell proliferation.",,diabetes
"Understanding the predictive accuracy of the InsuTAG index over other surrogate indices in normoglycaemic, non-obese males from Southern India.","We aimed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of InsuTAG index against M value of the hyperinsulinaemic-Euglycaemic clamp (HEC) procedure and fasting surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity/resistance in young, normoglycaemic, Asian Indian males. HEC studies were done in young (mean age 19.7 ± 1 years), non-obese (mean BMI 19.2 ± 2.6 kg/m2), normoglycemic Asian Indian males (n = 110) and the M value was calculated. Surrogate indices namely InsuTAG index, HOMA-IR, FG-IR, QUICKI and McAuley index were calculated. Pearson's correlation and ROC-AUC at 95% CI were applied. Significant negative correlation was observed for InsuTAG index with the M value (r - 0.23, p = 0.01), McAuley index (r - 0.65, p < 0.01), QUICKI (r - 0.34, p < 0.01) and FGIR (r - 0.35, p < 0.01). Significant positive correlations of InsuTAG index were observed for BMI and waist circumference. The ROC-AUC was higher for InsuTAG index (0.75) than FGIR (0.30), QUICKI (0.31), and McAuley index (0.20). The InsuTAG cut-off value ≥ 19.13 showed 66.7% sensitivity and 69.2% specificity in this study group.",,diabetes
Network analysis identifies circulating miR-155 as predictive biomarker of type 2 diabetes mellitus development in obese patients: a pilot study.,"Obesity is the main risk factor for many non-communicable diseases. In clinical practice, unspecific markers are used for the determination of metabolic alterations and inflammation, without allowing the characterization of subjects at higher risk of complications. Circulating microRNAs represent an attractive approach for early screening to identify subjects affected by obesity more at risk of developing connected pathologies. The aim of this study was the identification of circulating free and extracellular vesicles (EVs)-embedded microRNAs able to identify obese patients at higher risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2). The expression data of circulating microRNAs derived from obese patients (OB), with DM2 (OBDM) and healthy donors were combined with clinical data, through network-based methodology implemented by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The six circulating microRNAs overexpressed in OBDM patients were evaluated in a second group of patients, confirming the overexpression of miR-155-5p in OBDM patients. Interestingly, the combination of miR-155-5p with serum levels of IL-8, Leptin and RAGE was useful to identify OB patients most at risk of developing DM2. These results suggest that miR-155-5p is a potential circulating biomarker for DM2 and that the combination of this microRNA with other inflammatory markers in OB patients can predict the risk of developing DM2.",,diabetes
An effective method for culturing functional human corneal endothelial cells using a xenogeneic free culture medium.,"Endothelial dysfunction is a leading cause of corneal blindness in developed countries and the only available treatment is the endothelial transplantation. However, the limited availability of suitable donors remains a significant challenge, driving the exploration of alternative regenerative therapies. Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products show promise but must adhere to strict regulations that prohibit the use of animal-derived substances. This study investigates a novel culture methodology using Plasma Rich in Growth Factors (PRGF) as the only source of growth factors for primary cultures of human corneal endothelial cells (CECs). CECs were obtained from discarded corneas or endothelial rings and cultured in two different media: one supplemented with xenogeneic factors and other xenogeneic-free, using PRGF. Comprehensive characterization through immunofluorescence, morphological analyses, trans-endothelial electrical resistance measurements, RNA-seq, and qPCR was conducted on the two groups. Results demonstrate that CECs cultured in the xenogeneic-free medium exhibit comparable gene expression, morphology, and functionality to those cultured in the xenogeneic medium. Notably, PRGF-expanded CECs share 46.9% of the gene expression profile with native endothelium and express all studied endothelial markers. In conclusion, PRGF provides an effective source of xenogeneic-free growth factors for the culture of CECs from discarded corneal tissue. Further studies will be necessary to demonstrate the applicability of these cultures to cell therapies that make clinical translation possible.",,diabetes
Changes in peripapillary microvasculature in patients with type 2 diabetes patients: effect of systemic hypertension.,"To determine the effect of hypertension (HTN) on the peripapillary microvasculature in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without diabetic retinopathy (DR). The patients were classified into three groups: the control group (group 1), T2DM group (group 2), and both T2DM and HTN group (group 3). Peripapillary vessel density (VD) was compared using analysis of covariance and linear regression analysis was performed to identify the factors affecting the peripapillary VD. A total of 286 eyes were enrolled: 124 in group 1, 111 in group 2, and 51 in group 3. The peripapillary VDs for the full area were 18.3 ± 0.6, 17.8 ± 1.0, and 17.3 ± 1.2 mm-1 in group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively, which were significantly different after adjustment for age and best-corrected visual acuity (P < 0.001). In post hoc analyses, group 1 versus group 2 (P < 0.001), group 1 versus group 3 (P < 0.001), and group 2 versus group 3 (P = 0.001) showed significant differences. In linear regression analysis, HTN (B =  - 0.352, P = 0.043) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness (B = 0.045, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with peripapillary VD in T2DM patients. Peripapillary VD in T2DM patients without clinical DR were lower compared to normal controls, and they were more decreased when HTN was comorbid. The combination of ischemic damage by high blood pressure and impairment of the neurovascular unit by hyperglycemia would result in more severe deterioration of peripapillary microvasculature, and this impairment could be also reflected by pRNFL thinning.",,diabetes
Towards a practical use of text mining approaches in electrodiagnostic data.,"Healthcare professionals produce abounding textual data in their daily clinical practice. Text mining can yield valuable insights from unstructured data. Extracting insights from multiple information sources is a major challenge in computational medicine. In this study, our objective was to illustrate how combining text mining techniques with statistical methodologies can yield new insights and contribute to the development of neurological and neuromuscular-related health information. We demonstrate how to utilize and derive knowledge from medical text, identify patient groups with similar diagnostic attributes, and examine differences between groups using demographical data and past medical history (PMH). We conducted a retrospective study for all patients who underwent electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation in Israel's Sheba Medical Center between May 2016 and February 2022. The data extracted for each patient included demographic data, test results, and unstructured summary reports. We conducted several analyses, including topic modeling that targeted clinical impressions and topic analysis to reveal age- and sex-related differences. The use of suspected clinical condition text enriched the data and generated additional attributes used to find associations between patients' PMH and the emerging diagnosis topics. We identified 6096 abnormal EMG results, of which 58% (n = 3512) were males. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm we identified 25 topics that represent different diagnoses. Sex-related differences emerged in 7 topics, 3 male-associated and 4 female-associated. Brachial plexopathy, myasthenia gravis, and NMJ Disorders showed statistically significant age and sex differences. We extracted keywords related to past medical history (n = 37) and tested them for association with the different topics. Several topics revealed a close association with past medical history, for example, length-dependent symmetric axonal polyneuropathy with diabetes mellitus (DM), length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy with chemotherapy treatments and DM, brachial plexopathy with motor vehicle accidents, myasthenia gravis and NMJ disorders with botulin treatments, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with swallowing difficulty. Summarizing visualizations were created to easily grasp the results and facilitate focusing on the main insights. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing advanced computational methods in a corpus of textual data to accelerate clinical research. Additionally, using these methods allows for generating clinical insights, which may aid in the development of a decision-making process in real-life clinical practice.",,diabetes
Beinaglutide for weight management in Chinese individuals with overweight or obesity: A phase 3 randomized controlled clinical study.,"To investigate the efficacy and safety of beinaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention among non-diabetic Chinese individuals with overweight or obesity. This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ChiCTR1900023428) included 427 Chinese adults with a body mass index of 28 kg/m2 or higher (obesity) or 24-27.9 kg/m2 (overweight) with weight-related complications. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 0.2 mg of beinaglutide (subcutaneous) thrice daily or placebo for 16 weeks. Co-primary endpoints were body weight change and the proportion of patients with a weight reduction of 5% or more. Mean body weight change from baseline to week 16 was -6.0% and -2.4% in the beinaglutide (n = 282) and placebo (n = 138) groups, respectively; the mixed model repeated measures difference was -3.6% (95% confidence interval: -4.6% to -2.6%; P < .0001). At week 16, more beinaglutide-treated patients achieved a weight reduction of 5% or more (58.2% vs. 25.4% [placebo], odds ratio: 4.4; P < .0001) and of 10% or more (21.3% vs. 5.1% [placebo], odds ratio: 5.5; P < .0001). Beinaglutide also resulted in greater waist circumference reduction (difference: -1.81 cm; P < .01). The weight regain rate 12 weeks after beinaglutide treatment was 0.78%. Nausea (transient and mild-to-moderate) was the most common adverse event in the beinaglutide group (49.3% vs. 7.1% [placebo]). More patients receiving beinaglutide discontinued treatment because of adverse events (5.9% vs. 0.7% [placebo]). Pancreatitis or an increased resting heart rate was not observed in the beinaglutide group. Beinaglutide combined with lifestyle intervention resulted in significant and clinically meaningful weight reduction with good tolerance in non-diabetic Chinese individuals with overweight or obesity.",GLP-1;beinaglutide;body mass index;obesity;overweight,diabetes

"The effects of 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training on FGF21, irisin, and myostatin in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","This study investigated the influence of a 12-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on irisin, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and myostatin (MSTN) among men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Forty-five adult men with T2DM were randomly selected and assigned to receive and perform HIIT (4 × 4 min at 85-95% HRmax with three min of active rest at 50-60% HRmax in between) and MICT (walking/running continuously for 47 min at 60-70% HRmax) three sessions per week for 12 weeks, or to act as a non-exercise control (CON) group. The subjects' blood samples were collected at baseline and 48 hours after the last intervention session. Our research revealed that both interventions resulted in similar decreases in FGF21 and MSTN when compared to the CON (p < .01). However, only the HIIT group showed a significant increase in irisin (p < .01) compared to the CON. Further, improvements in insulin resistance, body composition, and VO2 peak were noted in both intervention groups compared with those of the CON group (p < .01). It seems that while either aerobic exercise strategy could be seen as a therapy for men with T2DM, HIIT had a more advantageous effect on the irisin response.",FGF21;Type 2 diabetes mellitus;high-intensity interval training;irisin;moderate-intensity continuous training;myostatin,diabetes

The effect of hormonal secretion on survival in adrenocortical carcinoma: A multi-center study.,"Current evidence suggests that cortisol secreting adrenocortical carcinoma has worse prognosis compared to non-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma. However, the effect of other secretory subtypes is unknown. This multicenter study within the American-Australian-Asian Adrenal Alliance included adults with adrenocortical carcinoma (1997-2020). We compared overall survival and disease-free survival among cortisol secreting, mixed cortisol/androgen secreting, androgen secreting, and non-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma. Of the 807 patients (mean age 50), 719 included in the secretory subtype analysis: 24.5% were cortisol secreting, 13% androgen secreting, 28% mixed cortisol/androgen, 32.5% non-secreting, and 2% were mineralocorticoid secreting. Median overall survival and disease-free survival for the entire cohort were 60 and 9 months, respectively. Median overall survival was 36 months for cortisol, 30 for mixed, 60 for androgen secreting, and 115 for non-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma, P < .01. Median disease-free survival was 7 months for cortisol, 8 for mixed, 10 for androgen, and 12 for non-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma, P = .06. On multivariable analysis of age, sex, Ki67%, secretory subtype, stage, resection, and adjuvant therapy, predictors of worse overall survival were older age, higher Ki67%, stage IV, mixed secreting, R1, and no adjuvant therapy, P < .05. On subgroup analysis of R0 resection, predictors of worse overall survival included older age and higher Ki67%. Ki67% ≥40, stage III and cortisol secretion were associated with worse disease-free survival. Mixed cortisol/androgen secreting adrenocortical carcinoma was associated with worse overall survival, while cortisol or androgen secreting alone were not. Notably, among patients after R0 resection, secretory subtype did not affect overall survival. Cortisol secreting adrenocortical carcinoma demonstrated worse disease-free survival. Ki67% remained a strong predictor of worse overall survival and disease-free survival independent of stage.",,diabetes
Tryptophan metabolites and incident cardiovascular disease: The EPIC-Norfolk prospective population study.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the largest cause of death globally due to various risk factors. One novel potential contributor to CVD might be the metabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp), which through many pathways can produce immunomodulatory metabolites such as kynurenine, indole-3-propionate and serotonin. We aim to identify the metabolites with the strongest association with cardiovascular disease, utilizing a substantial and diverse cohort of individuals. In our pursuit of this aim, our primary focus is to validate and reinforce the findings from previous cross-sectional studies. We used the community-based EPIC-Norfolk cohort (46.3 % men, age 59.8 ± 9.0) with a median follow-up of 22.1 (17.6-23.3) years to study associations between the relative levels of Trp metabolites measured with untargeted metabolomics and incident development of CVD. Serum from n = 11,972 apparently healthy subjects was analysed, of which 6982 individuals had developed CVD at the end of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models were used to study associations, adjusted for sex, age, conventional cardiovascular risk factors and CRP. All metabolites were Ln-normalised prior to analysis. Higher levels of Trp were inversely associated with mortality (HR 0.73; CI 0.64-0.83) and fatal CVD (HR 0.76; CI 0.59-0.99). Higher levels of kynurenine (HR 1.33; CI 1.19-1.49) and the [Kynurenine]/[Tryptophan]-ratio (HR 1.24; CI 1.14-1.35) were associated with a higher incident development of CVD. Serotonin was not associated with overall CVD, but we did find associations for myocardial infarction and stroke. Adjustment for CRP did not yield any discernible differences in effect size. Tryptophan levels were inversely correlated with CVD, while several of its major metabolites (especially kynurenine and serotonin) were positively correlated. These findings indicate that mechanistic studies are required to understand the role of Trp metabolism in CVD with the goal to identify new therapeutic targets.",Cardiovascular Disease;Epidemiology;Inflammation;Metabolites;Tryptophan,diabetes
Lipid-lowering in diabetes: An update.,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is accelerated in people with diabetes. Dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation play a role via a variety of mechanisms operative in the artery wall. In addition, some unique features predispose people with type 1 diabetes to accelerated atherosclerosis. Various organizations have created guidelines that provide advice regarding screening, risk assessment, and roadmaps for treatment to prevent ASCVD in diabetes. Management of dyslipidemia, especially with statins, has proven to be of immense benefit in the prevention of clinical CVD. However, since many patients fail to attain the low levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) recommended in these guidelines, supplemental therapy, such as the addition of ezetimibe, bempedoic acid or PCSK9 inhibitors, is often required to reach LDL goals. As a result, the upfront use of combination therapies, particularly a statin plus ezetimibe, is a rational initial approach. The addition to statins of drugs that specifically lower triglyceride levels has not proven beneficial, although the addition of icosapent-ethyl has been shown to be of value, likely by mechanisms independent of triglyceride lowering. Newer treatments in development, including apoC-III and ANGPTL3 inhibitors, seem promising in further reducing apoB-containing lipoproteins.",,diabetes
Sex Differences in Pharmacotherapy and Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Ischaemic Heart Disease and Comorbid Left Ventricular Dysfunction.,"Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) are common among women. However, women tend to present later and are less likely to receive guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) compared with men. We analysed prospectively collected data (2005-2018) from a multicentre registry on GDMT 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention in 13,015 patients with LV ejection fraction <50%. Guideline-directed medical therapy was defined as beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker±mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Long-term mortality was determined by linkage with the Australian National Death Index. Women represented 20% (2,634) of the total cohort. Mean age was 65±12 years. Women were on average >5 years, with higher body mass index and higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, renal dysfunction, prior stroke, and rheumatoid arthritis. Guideline-directed medical therapy was similar between sexes (73% vs 72%; p=0.58), although women were less likely to be on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (80% vs 82%; p=0.02). Women were less likely to be on statin therapy (p<0.001) or a second antiplatelet agent (p=0.007). Women had higher unadjusted long-term mortality (25% vs 19%; p<0.001); however, there were no differences in long-term mortality between sexes on adjusted analysis (hazard ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.14; p=0.94). Rates of GDMT for LV dysfunction were high and similar between sexes; however, women were less likely to be on appropriate IHD secondary prevention. The increased unadjusted long-term mortality in women was attenuated in adjusted analysis, which highlights the need for optimisation of baseline risk to improve long-term outcomes of women with IHD and comorbid LV dysfunction.",Optimal medical therapy;Pharmacotherapy;Secondary prevention;Sex differences;Women's heart disease,diabetes
Adoption of new medicines in primary care: a comparison between the uptake of new oral anticoagulants and diabetes medicines.,"To gain insight in the uptake and practice variation in the prescription of two new medicine groups for common conditions in primary care (direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and incretin-based therapies) from introduction, around 2007, to 2019 and the correlation between the adoption of those medicines in primary care. Prescription data from general practices in the Dutch Nivel Primary Care Database from 2007-2019 were used. The percentage of patients with prescriptions for DOACs of all patients with prescriptions for DOACs and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) was calculated per practice per year, as was the percentage of patients prescribed incretin-based therapies as a proportion of all patients with diabetes medication. Multilevel models were used to estimate practice variation for DOACs and incretin-based therapies, expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Linear regression analysis was used to study the association between the prescription of DOACs and incretin-based therapies. Per year 46 to 424 general practices and 179,933 to 1,654,376 patients were included. In 2019, the mean percentage of patients per practice using DOACs or incretin-based therapies was 54.9% and 9.7%, respectively. The ICC decreased from 0.75 to 0.024 for DOACs and from 0.33 to 0.074 for incretin-based medicines during the study period. No clear correlation was found between the prescription of DOACs and incretin-based therapies. DOACs and incretin based therapies have different adoption profiles and practice variation is large, especially in the years before these medicines were introduced in guidelines.

Impact of a short online course on the accuracy of non-ophthalmic diabetic retinopathy graders in recognising glaucomatous optic nerves in Vietnam.,"To test an online training course for non-ophthalmic diabetic retinopathy (DR) graders for recognition of glaucomatous optic nerves in Vietnam. This was an uncontrolled, experimental, before-and-after study in which 43 non-ophthalmic DR graders underwent baseline testing on a standard image set, completed a self-paced, online training course and were retested using the same photographs presented randomly. Twenty-nine local ophthalmologists completed the same test without the training course. DR graders then underwent additional one-to-one training by a glaucoma specialist and were retested. Test performance (% correct, compared with consensus grades from four fellowship-trained glaucoma experts), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating (AUC) curve, were computed. Mean age of DR graders (32.6±5.5 years) did not differ from ophthalmologists (32.3±7.3 years, p=0.13). Online training required a mean of 297.9 (SD 144.6) minutes. Graders' mean baseline score (33.3%±14.3%) improved significantly after training (55.8%±12.6%, p<0.001), and post-training score did not differ from ophthalmologists (58.7±15.4%, p=0.384). Although grader sensitivity reduced before [85.5% (95% CI 83.5% to 87.3%)] versus after [80.4% (78.3% to 82.4%)] training, specificity improved significantly [47.8 (44.9 to 50.7) vs 79.8 (77.3 to 82.0), p<0.001]. Grader AUC also improved after training [66.6 (64.9 to 68.3)] to [80.1 (78.5 to 81.6), p<0.001]. Additional one-to-one grader training by a glaucoma specialist did not further improve grader scores. Non-ophthalmic DR graders can be trained to recognise glaucoma using a short online course in this setting, with no additional benefit from more expensive one-to-one training.

The aging gut: Symptoms compatible with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) in older adults in the general population.,"Little is known about changes in gastrointestinal symptoms compatible with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) with increasing age at the population level. The objective of this study was to describe the patterns of DGBI in individuals 65 years of age and above and contrasting them with those of younger adults. A community sample of 6300 individuals ages 18 and older in the US, UK, and Canada completed an online survey. Quota-based sampling was used to ensure equal proportion of sex and age groups (40% aged 18-39, 40% aged 40-64, 20% aged 65+) across countries, and to control education distributions. The survey included the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire for DGBI, demographic questions, questionnaires measuring overall somatic symptom severity and quality of life, and questions on healthcare utilization, medications, and surgical history. We included 5926 individuals in our analyses; 4700 were 18-64 years of age and 1226 were ages 65+. Symptoms compatible with at least one DGBI were less prevalent in participants ages 65+ vs. ages 18-64 years (34.1% vs. 41.3%, p < 0.0001). For symptoms compatible with upper GI DGBI, lower prevalence for most disorders was noted in the 65+ group. For lower GI DGBI, a different pattern was seen. Prevalence was lower in ages 65+ for irritable bowel syndrome and anorectal pain, but no differences from younger participants for the disorders defined by abnormal bowel habits (constipation and/or diarrhea) were seen. Fecal incontinence was the only DGBI that was more common in ages 65+. Having a DGBI was associated with reduced quality of life, more severe non-GI somatic symptoms, and increased healthcare seeking, both in younger and older participants. Symptoms compatible with DGBI are common, but most of these decrease in older adults at the population level, with the exception of fecal incontinence which increases. This pattern needs to be taken into account when planning GI health care for the growing population of older adults.",gastrointestinal;geriatric;gut-brain interaction;population survey,diabetes
Utilisation of cardiovascular preventive services in a rheumatoid arthritis population-based cohort.,"The objective is to examine utilisation of cardiovascular preventive services in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), compared with a non-RA population, and to examine cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening rates among RA patients without diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension or hyperlipidaemia to non-RA patients with one of these diagnoses. All ≥18-year-old patients with an RA diagnosis living in one of eight Minnesota counties on 1 January 2015 were included and matched (1:1) by sex, age and county to non-RA comparators. Rates of screening for CVD risk factors, including DM (ie, glucose), hypertension (ie, blood pressure) and hyperlipidaemia (ie, lipids), were compared between groups using Cox models. The study included 1614 patients with RA and 1599 non-RA comparators. DM screening was more common among patients with RA (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.19), as was hypertension screening (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.52). Hyperlipidaemia screening in RA was similar to comparators (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.10). Conversely, patients with RA and no CVD risk factors had a lower probability of undergoing diabetes (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.78) and hyperlipidaemia screening (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.79) than non-RA patients with only one CVD risk factor diagnosis. Hypertension screening was similar between both groups. RA patients undergo CVD preventive screening at rates at least comparable to the general population. However, patients with RA as their sole CVD risk factor were less likely to undergo screenings, despite an equivalent-to-higher risk as the traditional CVD risk factors. These findings demonstrate opportunities for improvement of RA patient care.",Cardiovascular Diseases;Hypertension;Rheumatoid Arthritis,diabetes
Controversies of Direct-Acting Antivirals in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) has been highly successful in achieving sustained virological response (SVR) with associated improvements in liver dysfunction, liver-related mortality, and transplant-free survival. There is a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with an annual incidence of 2% to 4% in patients with cirrhosis. Following DAAs treatment and achievement of SVR, the risk of incident and recurrent HCC drops significantly over time, with risk associated with demographic and liver disease-related factors. Several risk factors have been described including age, male, diabetes comorbidities, alcohol abuse, hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus-coinfection, and advanced liver disease or increased liver fibrosis. Recurrence risk after DAA therapy has been associated with baseline tumor burden, with increased risk with larger lesion(s), multifocal disease, elevated alpha-fetoprotein level, treatment type (curative vs palliative), and shorter interval between HCC complete response and DAA initiation. Overall, due to the heterogeneity among individual patient data and lack of adequately controlled data, there are no conclusive statements that can be drawn that DAAs exposure is directly associated with HCC occurrence or recurrence. However, the best available data suggest a decreased risk of incident HCC with DAA therapy and no increased risk of recurrence with DAAs after complete tumor response.",Direct-acting antivirals;Hepatitis C virus infection;Hepatocellular carcinoma,diabetes
A fatal misidentification: Burkholderia pseudomallei misidentified as Acinetobacter spp.,"A middle-aged uncontrolled diabetic with chronic kidney disease presented with high-grade fever, skin abscesses and cough for two weeks. His blood cultures grew Burkholderia pseudomallei. A few weeks prior, blood cultures drawn for PUO workup elsewhere grew an organism identified as Acinetobacter sp with an unusual susceptibility pattern. His fever responded to a short course of meropenem. In retrospect, the earlier blood culture had likely misidentified B.pseudomallei as Acinetobacter sp given the background history, risk factors and the peculiar susceptibility report. Through this case, we discuss important aspects of melioid diagnostics which may be clinically relevant to establish this diagnosis.",Acinetobacter sp;Burkholderia pseudomallei;Misidentification,diabetes
A unique case of Salmonella typhi peritonitis in a CAPD patient.,"Peritonitis is the Achilles heel of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) leading to significant morbidity and mortality. We report a 57 year old lady with coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension and diabetic kidney disease on CAPD for four years, who presented with Salmonella typhi peritonitis. As response to intraperitoneal antibiotics was unsatisfactory, the peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed after five days and shifted to maintenance hemodialysis. Following resolution of infection after a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, a swan neck catheter was re-implanted after eight weeks. There was peritoneal membrane failure and hence she continued on hemodialysis but she succumbed.",Peritoneal dialysis;Peritonitis;Salmonella typhi,diabetes
"Presence of fimH and iss type 1, 2 and 3 genes in uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates recovered from an apex medical institute in North India.","To detect the presence of fimH and iss type 1, 2 and 3 genes in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) isolates recovered from patients coming to the out patient department (OPD) of our hospital. E. coli isolates recovered from patients who had symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) were processed for the presence of fimH and iss genes. DNA was extracted using an in house method after which conventional PCR using forward and reverse primers targeting the four genes was carried out. The amplified products were electrophoresed and visualized in a gel documentation imager. Relevant demographic details of the patients were recorded on a pre-designed pro-forma and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates was done by disc diffusion method. fimH was present in 87.5% of UPEC isolates whereas iss type 1 was seen in 7.3%, type 2 in 4.2% and iss type 3 in 71.9% isolates. Age of the patients ranged from 3 months to 82 ​yrs (mean 43.5 SD ​± ​18.20). UTI was more common in females (60.2%) as compared to males patients (39.8%). Dysuria (66.7%) was the most common symptom in the studied subjects and diabetes mellitus (42.6%) the most common co-morbidity. A total of 56.5% patients gave a history of prior antibiotic intake. The UPEC isolates were resistant to most of the antibiotics tested. However all the isolates were sensitive to polymyxin B and colistin. Fosfomycin resistance was seen in 9.5% of the UPEC isolates harbouring fimH gene. This is the first study that highlights the presence of iss type 3 gene in UPEC isolates along with the fimH and iss type 1 and 2 genes. The results of this study can serve as a stepping stone for future in depth research into the significance of the iss genes in causing UTI.",Escherichia coli;Virulence genes;fimH;iss,diabetes
Personalised Care-and-Support-Planning in Singapore: Qualitative interviews with people living with diabetes.,"Personalised care-and-support-planning (CSP) is a person-centred approach for the care of persons living with long-term conditions. PACE-D or Patient Activation through Community Empowerment/ Engagement for Diabetes Management adapts the Year of Care Partnerships (YOCP) approach to CSP in the UK for persons living with diabetes at the Singapore polyclinic; multi-storey primary care hubs that provide affordable, multidisciplinary, comprehensive, and high-throughput public healthcare for the multi-ethnic, multi-lingual Singapore population. To explore the experience of PACE-D enrolled persons living with diabetes with personalised CSP at Singapore polyclinics. Qualitative interviews of persons living with diabetes who experienced personalised CSP at National University Polyclinics (NUP) between July 2020 and November 2021. PACE-D enrolled persons living with diabetes who experienced personalised CSP were purposively sampled. In-depth semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using Braun & Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis. 52 patients participated in the study. Patients reported that the care-planning-letter (CPL) prompted reflection and patient preparation for CSP conversations. PACE-D programme coordinators amplified self-management by playing advocate and confidant beyond administrative duties. CSP providers were perceived as partners-in-care, with more time to listen compared to usual consultations. Patient engagement was affected by language confidence. With adequate time and support, patients increased in confidence and agency both in CSP engagement and diabetes self-management. While language confidence may affect patient engagement, personalised CSP shows promise for strengthening patient engagement and self-management among persons living with diabetes at the Singapore polyclinic.",Diabetes Mellitus;Personalised Care and Support Planning;Primary Health Care,diabetes
Prospective Nested Case-Control Study of Dietary and Microbiological-Associated Levels and Dynamics of 5-Aminovaleric Acid Betaine (5-AVAB) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"This study aimed to evaluate the associations between dietary and microbiological factors, and the levels and dynamics of 5-amino valeric acid betaine (5-AVAB) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) through a prospective nested case-control study. An added meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between 5-AVAB levels and T2D risk. A total of 1200 T2D patients and 1200 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited for this study. Dietary information was collected through 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires, while fecal samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 5-AVAB levels were measured in plasma samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Multivariate logistic regression and general linear models were applied to evaluate the associations between 5-AVAB levels, dietary factors, and gut microbiota composition. The T2D patients exhibited significantly lower plasma 5-AVAB concentrations compared to the control group (P < .001). Lower 5-AVAB levels were associated with higher odds of T2D (adjusted OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.76-4.74). Higher intake of dietary factors, including fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), were positively associated with 5-AVAB levels. Furthermore, specific bacterial taxa were significantly associated with 5-AVAB levels. A meta-analysis of five studies corroborated the inverse association between 5-AVAB and T2D risk (pooled OR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.61-4.46). Our findings suggest that lower 5-AVAB levels are associated with an increased risk of T2D. Dietary factors and gut microbiota composition appear to significantly influence 5-AVAB levels. The potential use of 5-AVAB as a therapeutic target in T2D management is an exciting area of research that requires further investigation. If successful, it could lead to new treatment options for T2D patients, ultimately improving their long-term health outcomes and quality of life.",,diabetes
Effect of Dapagliflozin on Ventricular Remodeling and Prognosis in Patients with Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a common cardiovascular complication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and significantly increases the risk of disability and death in T2DM patients. Dapagliflozin inhibits blood glucose reabsorption, improves insulin resistance, and reduces the occurrence of long-term adverse cardiovascular events, indicating the importance of Dapagliflozin as a drug for type 2 diabetes patients and its close relationship with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. At present, there are few studies on the effects of Dapagliflozin intervention on ventricular remodeling and myocardial microperfusion in patients with ACS combined with T2DM after PCI. Between January 2019 and August 2023, a total of 35 patients diagnosed with Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and T2DM were chosen as the observation group using a multi-stage cluster sampling method. Concurrently, 35 patients with similar age, height, weight, and healthy physical examination results were selected as the control group during the same time frame. We collected demographic data, symptoms and underlying diseases of the two groups Before enrollment and 6 months after discharge and compared the data between the two groups. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify indicators with statistically significant differences and to summarize the potential risk factors that could impact ventricular remodeling in patients with Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and T2DM. There was significant difference in LDL-C between the two groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). After treatment, the levels of hs-CRP, FBG, HbAlc and IL-6 in both groups were significantly decreased, and the decrease was more obvious in the observation group, with statistical significance (P < .05). These results indicated that Dapagliflozin intervention could significantly inhibit postoperative inflammation in patients with ACS combined with T2DM after PCI. LVMI of Observation group patients was significantly higher than Comparison group, LVEDD and ESVI of Observation group patients were significantly lower than Comparison group. The difference was statistically significant (P < .05). These results indicated that Dapagliflozin intervention could significantly inhibit the improvement of blood glucose index, ventricular remodeling and myocardial microperfusion in patients with ACS combined with T2DM after PCI. After treatment, TIMI Flow Count Frame Count (CTFC) level and Myocardial Perfusion (TMPG) level in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the comparison group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). These results indicated that Dapagliflozin intervention could significantly inhibit ventricular remodeling and improve myocardial microperfusion in patients with ACS combined with T2DM after PCI. Dapagliflozin intervention can significantly inhibit inflammatory indexes in patients with Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease combined with T2DM after PCI, promote the improvement of blood glucose indexes, ventricular remodeling and myocardial microperfusion, and reduce the risk of occurrence.",,diabetes
Investigation of the Functional Requirements and Influencing Factors of Self-management App Use in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetes self-management apps can provide convenient and personalized health information and reduce glycosylated haemoglobin, weight, the occurrence of severe hypoglycaemia and disease burden. This study aims to describe the attitudes towards and needs of self-management apps among diabetic patients in China. A self-administered cross-sectional survey was offered to patients in Changzhou from March to December 2021. Participants were included if they were≥ 18 years old, had the ability to read and write, and completed the questionnaire independently. Responses were summarized using descriptive statistics. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with attitudes towards the use of self-management apps. We surveyed 615 diabetes patients and found that 60% of the patients were willing to use self-management applications. The scores indicating importance of functional needs were sequentially ordered as follows: contact and interaction with medical practitioners (4.16), reminder to assess blood glucose levels (4.07), alert indicating abnormal blood glucose levels (4.06), medication reminder (3.93), documentation of intake per meal (3.91), calculation of carbohydrate intake (3.85), graphic presentation of blood glucose levels (3.84), setting of personal goals (3.82), reminder to exercise (3.80), and providing diabetes knowledge (3.77). Factors influencing the usage of mobile applications included age (OR:0.956, 95%CI:0.935-0.977, P < .01), employed (OR:2.822, 95%CI:1.373-5.802, P < .05), medical insurance (OR:2.084, 95%CI:1.073-4.047, P < .05) and the eHealth Literacy Scale score (OR:1.128, 95%CI:1.088-1.169, P < .01). The main reason for unwillingness to use self-management applications was a lack of experience using it. The functional needs of patients using diabetes self-management apps include contacting and interacting with medical staff, recording and alarming blood glucose, reminding medicine, recording and calculating intake, providing graphic representation of blood glucose, setting health goals, recording exercise and sending diabetes knowledge. Age, employed, medical insurance and the eHealth Literacy Scale score were the factors influencing willingness to use self-management applications. The main reason for reluctance to use self-management applications was lack of experience.",,diabetes
"Portable, Intelligent Fluorescence Sensing Platform for Dense Convolutional Network-Capable Detection of Indophenol Sulfate and Methylmalonic Acid Using a Luminescent Eu@HOF Film.","Indophenol sulfate (IS) and methylmalonic acid (MMA) are biomarkers of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes polyneuropathy (DPN), respectively. Portable and accurate monitoring of IS and MMA is very important to ensuring human health. The dense convolutional network (DenseNet) with image recognition has great potential in fluorescence sensing, but developing a platform with high precision and portability to diagnose the disease still faces huge challenges. Herein, we developed a high-sensitivity platform with a fluorescence material, a smartphone, and the DenseNet to monitor IS and MMA. A red-emitting Eu@PFC-13 (1) is prepared, and 1 shows high selectivity and low detection limits (DLs) to detect IS and MMA. The sensing mechanism of 1 toward IS and MMA is investigated by experiments and theoretical calculation. For detecting IS and MMA in serum and urine, 1 is fabricated into an Eu@PFC-13/AG (2) film with DLs of 1.4 and 1.6 μM, respectively. In addition, a portable smartphone platform is designed to monitor IS and MMA with high precision. Moreover, the DenseNet is constructed by Python, which can output the concentration of analytes by identifying fluorescence images and judge whether any is in a dangerous range. This work not only proposes a novel method that integrates a fluorescence material, a smartphone, and deep learning to detect analytes but also opens a new way for the diagnosis of CKD and DPN.",dense convolutional network;fluorescence sensing platform;indophenol sulfate (IS);lanthanide functionalized hydrogen bonded organic frameworks;methylmalonic acid (MMA);smartphone,diabetes
Maggot debridement therapy stimulates wound healing by altering macrophage activation.,"The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of maggot debridement therapy (MDT) on macrophages during the healing process of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). The activation phenotype of macrophages during wound healing following MDT was evaluated using double staining immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, markers associated with macrophage activation were discovered using immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During the process of diabetic wound healing following MDT, the presence and over-expression of M2 macrophages were observed, while the under-expression of M1 macrophages was noted. In addition, the activation markers of macrophages exhibited a correlation with the indicated Th1/Th2 cytokines. MDT interventions have the potential to modulate macrophage activity, thereby aiding in the healing of diabetic foot wounds.",diabetic foot ulcer;macrophages;maggot debridement therapy;wound healing,diabetes
Changes in mesenteric fat thickness and its clinical impact in bariatric surgery.,"Obesity, especially central obesity is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study aimed to investigate the associations of the changes of abdominal fat thicknesses with changes of anthropometric indexes and improvements of metabolic phenotypes in patients with obesity and T2DM before and after bariatric surgery. Between April 2016 and January 2017, 34 adult patients with concurrent obesity and T2DM scheduled for different bariatric surgeries were prospectively evaluated by ultrasound before and 1-year after bariatric surgery to determine abdominal fat thicknesses (mesenteric fat, preperitoneal fat and subcutaneous fat) and NAFLD. At 1 year, of the 25 patients that finished the study, significant decrease in mesenteric-fat-thickness was associated with significant reduction of obesity, that is, BMI (-24%, p < .001), remission of metabolic syndrome (32%, p = .008), NAFLD (60%, p < .001) and T2DM (44%, p < .001). Lower baseline mesenteric fat thickness was associated with remission of metabolic syndrome. Lower baseline mesenteric-fat-thickness may have the potential to predict metabolic syndrome remission after bariatric surgery.",bariatric surgery;diabetes;mesenteric fat thickness;metabolic syndrome;obesity;ultrasound,diabetes
Carbohydrate counting and insulin analogs to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus. How to improve metabolic control?,"Clinical-laboratory comparison of a population of children and adolescents with DM1 followed at a Brazilian outpatient university clinic, at two different periods (2014 and 2020), regarding changes made both to the insulin therapy scheme and to the nutritional approach to carbohydrate counting. The data of patients with DM1 aged 0-19 years enrolled in the service in 2014 and 2020 were collected. Student's t-test was performed to compare the means of HbA1c and the variables of interest. NPH + regular insulin was predominantly used in 2014 (49.1%), while in 2020, the predominance shifted to insulin analogs (48.4%). Pump use tripled from 1.3% in 2014 to 4.4% in 2020, and the percentage of patients performing carbohydrate counting reduced from 28.3% to 17.8%. Regarding HbA1c, the 2014 group of patients had a mean of 9.8%, while the 2020 group had a mean of 9.6% (p = 0.49). The change in treatments between 2014 and 2020 did not result in a significant improvement in HbA1c levels.

Plasma from patients with Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia displays increased fibrinolytic potential and enhances tPA but not uPA-mediated plasminogen activation.,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare complication of adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. VITT is associated with markedly raised levels of D-dimer yet how VITT modulates the fibrinolytic system is unknown. We aimed to compare changes in fibrinolytic activity in plasma from patients with VITT, patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism post-vaccination but without VITT (VTE-no VITT), and healthy vaccinated controls. Plasma levels of plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) complexes, plasminogen, and alpha2-anti-plasmin (A2AP) from 10 patients with VITT, 10 patients with VTE-no VITT, and 14 healthy vaccinated controls were evaluated by ELISA and/or Western blotting. Fibrinolytic capacity was evaluated by quantitating PAP levels at baseline and after ex vivo plasma stimulation with 50nM tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) or urokinase (uPA) for 5 minutes. Baseline PAP complex levels in control and VTE-no VITT individuals were similar but were ∼7-fold higher in plasma from VITT patients (p<0.0001). VITT samples also revealed consumption of A2AP and fibrinogenolysis consistent with a hyperfibrinolytic state. Of interest, VITT plasma produced significantly higher PAP levels after ex vivo treatment with tPA, but not uPA compared to the other groups, indicative of increased fibrinolytic potential. This was not due to D-dimer as addition of D-dimer to VTE-no VITT plasma failed to potentiate tPA-induced PAP levels. A marked hyperfibrinolytic state occurs in patients with VITT, evidenced by marked elevations in PAP, A2AP consumption and fibrinogenolysis. An unidentified plasma cofactor that selectively potentiates tPA-mediated plasminogen activation also appears to exist in the plasma of patients with VITT.",Fibrinolysis;VITT;fibrinogenolysis;plasmin-antiplasmin complexes;plasminogen activation,diabetes
"Diabetes, Hypertension, and Smoking Do Not Affect Outcomes of Iliofemoral Vein Stenting for Chronic Proximal Venous Outflow Obstruction.","Diabetes, hypertension, and smoking are well-recognized risk factors for Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), but little is known of their impact on chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). This study evaluates these factors in patients undergoing iliac vein stenting (IVS) for CVI. A registry of 708 patients who underwent IVS from August 2011 to June 2021 was retrospectively analyzed. Symptoms were quantified using venous clinical severity score (VCSS) and CEAP classification. Both major and minor reinterventions were recorded. Logistic regression models were used to determine the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) of any reintervention. Log-rank test was used to assess differences in reintervention-free survival. The prevalence of hypertension was 51.1% (N = 362), diabetes was 23.0% (N = 163), and smoking was 22.2% (N = 157). Patients with diabetes (3.6 vs 3.4; P = 0.062), hypertension (3.6 vs. 3.3; P < 0.001), and smoking (3.7 vs 3.4; P = 0.003) had higher CEAP scores than those without these comorbidities. Improvement in VCSS composite scores showed no differences postoperatively (Diabetes: P = 0.513; Hypertension: P = 0.053; Smoking: P = 0.608), at 1-year follow-up (Diabetes: P = 0.666; Hypertension: P = 0.681; Smoking: P = 0.745), or at 5-year follow-up (Diabetes: P = 0.525; Hypertension: P = 0.953; Smoking: P = 0.146). Diabetes (P = 0.454), smoking (P = 0.355), and hypertension (P = 0.727) were not associated with increased odds of major reintervention. Log-rank test similarly showed no differences in reintervention-free survival for major or minor reoperations between those with and without diabetes (P = 0.79), hypertension (P = 0.14), and smoking (P = 0.80). Diabetes, hypertension, and smoking were prevalent among CVI patients, but unlike in PAD patients, they had little to no impact on long-term outcomes or reinterventions after IVS.",Iliac vein stenting;chronic venous disease;diabetes;hypertension;risk factors;smoking,diabetes
Combined effects of organochlorine pesticides on type 2 diabetes mellitus: Insights from endocrine disrupting effects of hormones.,"Association between organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) exposure and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains contradictory, and the evidence is mostly focused on a single exposure. Here, we assessed the associations between individual and combined OCPs exposure and T2DM, and explored the underlying mechanism of sex hormones and the methylation levels of sex hormone receptors in above associations. A case-control study with 1812 participants was performed. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pyrosequencing were used to measure plasma OCPs, serum sex hormones, and whole blood methylation levels of sex hormone receptors, respectively. Generalized linear models were used to analyze the relationships between OCPs, sex hormones, the methylation levels of sex hormone receptors, and T2DM. Quantile based g-computation (QGC) and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) were employed to assess the combined OCPs exposure. The roles of sex hormones and the methylation levels of their receptors were evaluated by moderating mediation models. After adjusting for covariates, each unit (2.718 ng/ml) increase in p,p'-DDE was associated with a higher risk of T2DM in males (odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.066 (1.023, 1.112)). QGC and BKMR showed a positive combined effect in the associations of OCPs mixtures on T2DM among premenopausal females, and positive effects but not statistically significant among males and postmenopausal females. p,p'-DDE was the largest contributor for the positive associations. Furthermore, testosterone mediated 21.149% of the associations of p,p'-DDE with T2DM moderated by the androgen receptor methylation (ARm) located in CpG island 1. Individual and mixtures of OCPs exposure were positively linked to elevated risk of T2DM. Testosterone and ARm may participate in the related processes of OCPs with T2DM, providing new insights into the adverse endocrine effects caused by OCPs and specific pathways for the etiology and control of diabetes.",Combined exposure;Methylation;Organochlorine pesticides;Testosterone;Type 2 diabetes mellitus,diabetes
"The chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin induces brain senescence, with modulation by APOE genotype.","Many cancer patients experience serious cognitive problems related to their treatment, which can greatly affect their quality of life. The molecular mechanisms of this cancer chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) are unknown, thus slowing the development of preventative approaches. We hypothesized that cancer chemotherapies could induce cellular senescence in the brain, creating a pro-inflammatory environment and damaging normal brain communication. We tested this hypothesis using the common chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin in two independent mouse models. In the first model, we used mice that express tdTomato under the pdkn2a (p16) promoter; p16 is a regulator of cellular senescence, and its upregulation is denoted by the presence of fluorescently tagged cells. Two weeks after exposure to three doses of 5 mg/kg doxorubicin, the number of tdTomato positive cells were increased nearly three-fold in both the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. tdTomato staining co-localized with neurons, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and endothelial cells, but not astrocytes. In the second model, we used APOE knock-in mice, since the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for CICI in humans and mouse models. We isolated RNA from the cerebral cortex of APOE3 and APOE4 mice from one to 21 days after a single dose of 10 mg/kg doxorubicin. Using NanoString analysis of over 700 genes related to neuroinflammation and RT-qPCR analysis of cerebral cortex transcripts, we found two-fold induction of four senescence-related genes at three weeks in the APOE4 mice compared to the APOE3 control mice: p21(cdkn1a), p16, Gadd45a, and Egr1. We conclude that doxorubicin promotes cellular senescence pathways in the brain, supporting the hypothesis that drugs to eliminate senescent cells could be useful in preventing CICI.",Alzheimer's disease;ApoE;Apolipoprotein E;Cancer chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment;Senescence,diabetes
Pancreatic beta cell regenerative potential of Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl. Aqueous stem bark extract.,"Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl. is endemic to Africa and has been used traditionally to treat diabetes mellitus. Moreover, its pharmacological efficacy has been confirmed experimentally using in vitro and in vivo models of diabetes. However, the effects of Z. chalybeum extracts and its major constituent compounds on beta cell and islet regeneration are not clear. Further, the mechanisms associated with observed antidiabetic effects at the beta cell level are not fully elucidated. We determined the beta cell regenerative efficacy of Z. chalybeum aqueous stem bark extract, identified the chemical compounds in Z. chalybeum aqueous stem bark extracts and explored their putative mechanisms of action. Phytochemical profiling of the Z. chalybeum extract was achieved using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Thereafter, molecular interactions of the compounds with beta cell regeneration targets were evaluated via molecular docking. In vitro, effects of the extract on cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative stress were investigated in RIN-5F beta cells exposed to palmitate or streptozotocin. In vivo, pancreas tissue sections from streptozotocin-induced diabetic male Wistar rats treated with Z. chalybeum extract were stained for insulin, glucagon, pancreatic duodenal homeobox protein 1 (Pdx-1) and Ki-67. Based on ligand target and molecular docking interactions diosmin was identified as a dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) inhibitor. In vitro, Z. chalybeum augmented cell viability and cell proliferation while in palmitate-pre-treated cells, the extract significantly increased cell activity after 72 h. In vivo, although morphometric analysis showed decreased islet and beta cell size and density, observation of increased Pdx-1 and Ki-67 immunoreactivity in extract-treated islets suggests that Z. chalybeum extract has mild beta cell regenerative potential mediated by increased cell proliferation. Overall, the mitogenic effects observed in vitro, were not robust enough to elicit sufficient recovery of functional beta cell mass in our in vivo model, in the context of a sustained diabetic milieu. However, the identification of diosmin as a potential Dyrk1A inhibitor merits further inquiry into the attendant molecular interactions.",Beta cell mass;Beta cell proliferation;Mitogenic targets;Molecular docking;Type 2 diabetes,diabetes
Evaluation of anti-inflammatory potential and GC-MS profiling of leaf extracts from Clerodendrum infortunatum L.,"Clerodendrum infortunatum L. is commonly distributed in tropical and subtropical countries and is widely used in the indigenous systems of medicine including Ayurveda, Unani, and Homeopathy. The plant has important uses in the treatment of various inflammatory disorders which includes asthma, cough, chest complaints, pain, rheumatism, osteoarthritis, gastric ulcer, cancer, diabetes, skin diseases etc. AIM OF THE STUDY: Regarding the extensive healing properties of C. infortunatum in folk medicine, we aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of the plant and analyze its bioactive components. Sequential extracts were prepared from C. infortunatum leaves using n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol and water. In vitro anti-inflammatory activity of these extracts were evaluated using membrane stabilization and protein anti-denaturation assays. Toxicity of the extracts was tested using brine shrimp lethality assay. GC-MS analysis has been carried out to analyze and characterize various bioactive constituents present in the plant. Each of the tested extracts showed significant (p < 0.05) in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Sequential ethyl acetate extract demonstrated the strongest membrane stabilization and protein anti-denaturation activities with IC50 values of 331.3, 308.3 and 279.2 μg/mL for heat and hypotonicity induced membrane stabilization and protein anti-denaturation assays, respectively. Sequential methanol extract also exhibited strong activity in heat and hypotonicity induced membrane stabilization and protein anti-denaturation assays with IC50 values of 371.5, 331.6 and 284.6 μg/mL, respectively. The extracts demonstrated a range of toxicity in the brine shrimp lethality assay with LC50 values of 51.4, 59.7, 47.3, 37.1, 68.1 and 77.3 μg/mL for n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol and water extracts respectively. The GC-MS analysis of direct n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts detected 32 different compounds. The major compounds (>5%) were phenol, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, estragole, methyl stearate, lanosterol, 9-methoxybicyclo[6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene, benzenepropanoic acid, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl) 4 hydroxy methyl ester, 22,23-dibromostigmasterol acetate, 3-methyl-4-(phenylthio)-2-prop-2-enyl-2,5-dihydrothiophene 1,1-dioxide, benzenemethanol, .alpha.-methyl-.alpha.-propyl- and 9-octadecenoic acid (Z)- methyl ester. The findings of our study revealed that C. infortunatum is rich with diverse bioactive phytoconstituents and the scientific evidences support the anti-inflammatory potential of the plant.",Bioactive constituents;Clerodendrum infortunatum;Cytotoxicity;Inflammation;Membrane stabilization;Protein anti-denaturation;Sequential extract,diabetes
Cell sheet-based approach to study the diabetic corneal stroma.,"Prolonged hyperglycemia during diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with severe complications that may affect both the anterior and posterior ocular segments, leading to impaired vision or blindness. The cornea is a vital part of the eye that has a dual role as a protective transparent barrier and as a major refractive structure and is likewise negatively affected by hyperglycemia in DM. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic changes associated with DM is critical to developing targeted therapies to promote tissue integrity. In this proof-of-concept study, we applied a cell sheet-based approach to generate stacked constructs of physiological corneal thickness using primary human corneal fibroblasts isolated from cadaveric control (healthy), Type 1 DM and Type 2 DM corneal tissues. Self-assembled corneal stromal sheets were generated after 2 weeks in culture, isolated, and subsequently assembled to create stacked constructs, which were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy. Analysis of gene expression patterns revealed significant downregulation of fibrotic markers, α-smooth muscle actin, and collagen type 3, with stacking in Type 2 DM constructs when compared to controls. IGF1 expression was significantly upregulated in Type 2 DM constructs compared to controls with a significant reduction induced by stacking. This study describes the development of a thicker, self-assembled corneal stromal construct as a platform to evaluate phenotypic differences associated with DM-derived corneal fibroblasts and enable the development of targeted therapeutics to promote corneal integrity.",Cornea;In vitro models;Stacking;Stroma;Tissue engineering,diabetes
Formononetin attenuates high glucose-induced neurotoxicity by negatively regulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Schwann cells via activation of SIRT3.,"High glucose induces Schwann cells death and neurotoxicity. Formononetin was originally found in Astragalus membranaceus and showed anti-tumor and anti-neuroinflammation properties. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of formononetin and identify its direct protein target. The effects of formononetin on oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Schwann cells induced by high glucose were investigated. High glucose treatment significantly induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in Schwann cells, while these effects were partially or completely prevented by co-treatment with formononetin. Mechanistically, we found that SIRT3/PGC-1α/SOD2 pathway was activated by formononetin under high glucose conditions as evidenced by western blotting. Knockdown of SIRT3 by siRNA delivery reversed the protective effects of formononetin on high glucose-induced Schwann cells injury and changes in expression profile of SIRT3 downstream target genes. Molecular docking, thermal shift assay and surface plasmon resonance assay revealed a direct binding between formononetin and SIRT3. Taken together, we identified a novel SIRT3 activator formononetin and revealed its beneficial effects on high glucose-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting that targeting SIRT3 in Schwann cells may be a new approach for treatment of peripheral nerve regeneration related diseases such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy.",Formononetin;High glucose;Oxidative stress;SIRT3;Schwann cells,diabetes
Plasma Metabolomics of Dietary Intake of Protein-Rich Foods and Kidney Disease Progression in Children.,"There is inconsistent evidence on the efficacy of a low-protein diet for CKD patients and recommending a low-protein diet for pediatric patients is controversial. There is also a lack of objective biomarkers of dietary intake. The purpose of this study was to identify plasma metabolites associated with dietary intake of protein and to assess whether protein-related metabolites are associated with CKD progression. Non-targeted metabolomics was conducted in plasma samples from 484 Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) participants. Multivariable linear regression estimated the cross-sectional association between 949 known, non-drug metabolites and dietary intake of total protein, animal protein, plant protein, chicken, dairy, nuts and beans, red and processed meat, fish, and eggs, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and dietary covariates. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the prospective association between protein-related metabolites and CKD progression defined as the initiation of kidney replacement therapy or 50% eGFR reduction, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. 127 (26%) children experienced CKD progression during 5 years of follow-up. Sixty metabolites were significantly associated with dietary protein intake. Among the 60 metabolites, 10 metabolites were significantly associated with CKD progression (animal protein: n=1, dairy: n=7, red and processed meat: n=2, nuts and beans: n=1), including one amino acid, one cofactor and vitamin, four lipids, two nucleotides, one peptide, and one xenobiotic. 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-2-oleoyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE, P-16:0/18:1) was positively associated with dietary intake of red and processed meat, and a doubling of its abundance was associated with 88% higher risk of CKD progression. 3-ureidopropionate was inversely associated with dietary intake of red and processed meat, and a doubling of its abundance was associated with 48% lower risk of CKD progression. Untargeted plasma metabolomic profiling revealed metabolites associated with dietary intake of protein and CKD progression in a pediatric population.",children;chronic kidney disease;dietary intake;protein;red meat,diabetes

Fasted C-peptide Distribution and Associated Clinical Factors in Adults with Longstanding Type 1 Diabetes: Analysis of the Canadian Study of Longevity in Type 1 Diabetes.,"Although insulin production is reportedly retained in many with longstanding type 1 diabetes, the magnitude and relevance of C-peptide production are not known with certainty. We aimed to define fasted C-peptide distributions and associated clinical factors. In cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Study of Longevity, fasted serum and urinary C-peptide was measured in 74 patients with longstanding T1D (duration ≥ 50 years) and 75 age- and sex-matched controls. Extensive phenotyping for complications was performed and patient-reported variables were included. C-peptide distributions were analyzed, and multivariable logistic regression was used to examine variable association in T1D participants. The 74 T1D participants had mean age 66±8 years, duration of diabetes 54[52,58] years, and HbA1C 7.4±0.8% (56.8±9.15 mmol/mol). The 75 controls had mean age 65±8 years and HbA1C 5.7±0.4% (38.4±4.05 mmol/mol). Participants with T1D had lower fasted serum C-peptide than controls (0.013 nmol/L ± 0.022 vs. 1.595 nmol/L ±1.099, p<0.001). Of the T1D participants, C-peptide was detectable in 30/73(41%) of serum samples, 32/74(43%) of urine samples, and 48/74(65%) in either serum or urine. The variables independently associated with detectable serum or urinary C-peptide were lower total daily insulin requirement (OR 2.351 [for 1 lower unit/kg], p=0.013) and lower hypoglycemia worry score (OR 1.059 [for 1 point lower on the hypoglycemia fear survey worry sub-score], p=0.030). While detectable C-peptide in longstanding diabetes was common, the magnitude of concentration was extremely low when compared to age-and sex-matched controls. Despite minimal detectability, its presence is validated by lower insulin requirements and strongly associated with lower hypoglycemia worry.",C-peptide;Canadian Study of Longevity in Type 1 Diabetes;Hypoglycemia Fear Survey;Total Daily Insulin;Type 1 Diabetes,diabetes
Optical coherence tomography in the management of diabetic macular oedema.,"Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is the major cause of visual impairment in people with diabetes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now the most widely used modality to assess presence and severity of DMO. DMO is currently broadly classified based on the involvement to the central 1 mm of the macula into non-centre or centre involved DMO (CI-DMO) and DMO can occur with or without visual acuity (VA) loss. This classification forms the basis of management strategies of DMO. Despite years of research on quantitative and qualitative DMO related features assessed by OCT, these do not fully inform physicians of the prognosis and severity of DMO relative to visual function. Having said that, recent research on novel OCT biomarkers development and re-defined classification of DMO show better correlation with visual function and treatment response. This review summarises the current evidence of the association of OCT biomarkers in DMO management and its potential clinical importance in predicting VA and anatomical treatment response. The review also discusses some future directions in this field, such as the use of artificial intelligence to quantify and monitor OCT biomarkers and retinal fluid and identify phenotypes of DMO, and the need for standardisation and classification of OCT biomarkers to use in future clinical trials and clinical practice settings as prognostic markers and secondary treatment outcome measures in the management of DMO.",Diabetic macular oedema;Diabetic retinal neurodegeneration;Diabetic retinopathy;Optical coherence tomography,diabetes
The level of serum retinol-binding protein is associated with diabetic mild cognitive impairment.,"Several studies have shown that retinol-binding protein (RBP) is linked to diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. However, no studies have elucidated the relationship between RBP and diabetic cognitive disorders. To determine whether the change characteristics of serum RBP are associated with alterations in cognitive functioning in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, 252 patients with T2DM and 34 people as healthy controls were included. According to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the diabetic subjects were divided into the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group and the Non-MCI group. Demographic characteristics and clinical indicators as well as serum RBP levels were analyzed. The serum RBP levels in the MCI group were lower compared with the Non-MCI group (P = 0.02). The level of RBP was higher in the diabetes without MCI group than in the healthy control (P < 0.001). Serum RBP levels were positively correlated with MoCA scores (r = 0.178, P = 0.003). Binary Logistic regression model analysis showed that low RBP [odds ratio (OR) = 0.936], old age (OR = 1.074), high fasting blood glucose (OR = 1.164), and low fasting C-peptide (OR = 0.722) may be independent risk factors for diabetic MCI. The ROC curve of serum RBP for predicting diabetic MCI showed that the area under the curve was 0.630. Our study revealed an association between serum RBP and diabetic MCI. Serum RBP levels in diabetic MCI are lower and correlated with cognitive function.",Diabetic complication;Diabetic mild cognitive impairment;Retinol-binding protein;Type 2 diabetes,diabetes
Catecholamine-induced hypertensive crises: current insights and management.,"Phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) release catecholamines leading to catecholamine-induced hypertensive (CIH) crises, with blood pressure greater than or equal to 180/120 mm Hg. CIH crises can be complicated by tachyarrhythmias, hypotension, or life-threatening target organ damage while treatment remains undefined, often requiring co-management between endocrinologists and cardiologists. Furthermore, biochemical diagnosis of a PPGL as a cause of a CIH crisis can be difficult to identify or confounded by comorbid conditions, potentially resulting in misdiagnosis. Here, we combine relevant evidence, 60 years of collective clinical experience, insights derived from assessing over 2600 patients with PPGL, and supplementary outcomes from 100 patients (treated at the National Institutes of Health) with a CIH crisis to inform diagnosis and treatment of CIH crises. Recognising that disparities exist between availability, cost, and familiarity of various agents, flexible approaches are delineated allowing for customisation, given institutional availability and provider preference. A CIH crisis and its complications are readily treatable with available drugs, with effective intervention defining an avenue for mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality in patients with PPGL.",,diabetes
Ayurveda for a type 1 diabetes patient with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD).,"The effect of Ayurvedic therapy in type 2 diabetes (t2d) is well documented. For people with type 1 diabetes (t1d), there is little evidence on the applicability of Ayurvedic therapy. This case illustrates the course of Ayurvedic treatment in a person with t1d accompanied by peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). The patient had insulin-dependent t1d since the age of 6 years. At 39 years of age, he developed progressive bilateral peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) of the femoral arteries. He presented claudication symptoms at a walking distance of 150m. 10 surgical interventions for recanalization have been performed. The PAOD put heavy psychological strains on the patient. He developed moderate depression with anxiety and complains of tinnitus and sleep disturbances. Through an initial outpatient Ayurvedic treatment focused on dietary and lifestyle changes, phytotherapeutics and a subsequent 6-week inpatient Ayurvedic treatment in India, a weight reduction of 12 kg, a reduction in insulin requirement to 65% of baseline, as well as a walking performance without restriction at medium load could be achieved. The depression and inner tension completely retreated, one-sided tinnitus, and existing sleep disturbances dissolved completely. The lasting effect was still perceptible 5 months after the inpatient stay. For this person with t1d with PAOD, outpatient and inpatient Ayurvedic therapy could generate a significant improvement of his situation. The case demonstrates that people with t1d can benefit from individualized Ayurvedic therapy. This case motivates to invest in Ayurvedic research for people with t1d and complications.",,diabetes

Effects of dapagliflozin monotherapy and combined aerobic exercise on skeletal muscle mitochondrial quality control and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus rats.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent, chronic metabolic disease. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and aerobic exercise (AE) have shown promise in mitigating insulin resistance (IR) and T2DM. This study investigated the effects of dapagliflozin (Dapa) monotherapy and combined AE on mitochondrial quality control (MQC) in skeletal muscle and IR in T2DM rats. T2DM rats, induced by a high-fat diet/streptozotocin model, were randomly assigned to the following groups: T2DM+vehicle group (DMV), T2DM rats treated with Dapa (DMDa, 10 mg/kg/d), T2DM rats subjected to combined Dapa treatment and AE (DMDa+AE), and the standard control group (CON). Blood and skeletal muscle samples were collected after 6 weeks of intragastric administration and treadmill exercise. The results showed that DMDa monotherapy could reduce the accumulation of white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle lipid droplets and improve HOMA-IR. While the combined AE led to further reductions in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and fasting glucose levels, it did not confer additional benefits in terms of HOMA-IR. Furthermore, Dapa monotherapy enhanced skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, NRF1, TFAM, and COX IV), mitochondrial dynamics (OPA1, DRP1, and MFN2), and mitophagy (PGAM5 and PINK1) related protein levels. Nevertheless, the combination of Dapa with AE treatment did not yield an additive effect. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of SGLT2 inhibitors, specifically Dapa, in ameliorating IR and maintaining MQC in skeletal muscle in rats with T2DM. However, combined AE did not produce an additive effect, indicating the need for further research.",Aerobic exercise;Dapagliflozin;Insulin resistance;Mitochondrial quality control;Skeletal muscle;Type 2 diabetes mellitus,diabetes
Phytosterols activating nuclear receptors are involving in steroid hormone-dependent cancers: Myth or fact?,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) represent intracellular proteins that function as a signaling network of transcriptional factors to control genes in response to a variety of environmental, dietary, and hormonal stimulations or serve as orphan receptors lacking a recognized ligand. They also play an essential role in normal development, metabolism, cell growth, cell division, physiology, reproduction, and homeostasis and function as biological markers for tumor subclassification and as targets for hormone therapy. NRs, including steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), have been studied as tools to examine the fundamentals of transcriptional regulation within the development of mammals and human physiology, in addition to their links to disturbances. In this regard, it is widely recognized that aberrant NR signaling is responsible for the pathological growth of hormone-dependent tumors in response to SHRs dysregulation and consequently represents a potential therapeutic candidate in a range of diseases, as in the case of prostate cancer and breast cancer. On the other hand, phytosterols are a group of plant-derived compounds that act directly as ligands for NRs and have proven their efficacy in the management of diabetes, heart diseases, and cancers. However, these plants are not suggested in cases of hormone-dependent cancer since a certain group of plants contains molecules with a chemical structure similar to that of estrogens, which are known as phytoestrogens or estrogen-like compounds, such as lignans, coumestans, and isoflavones. Therefore, it remains an open and controversial debate regarding whether consuming a phytosterol-rich diet and adopting a vegetarian lifestyle like the Mediterranean diet may increase the risk of developing steroid hormone-dependent cancers by constitutively activating SHRs and thereby leading to tumor transformation. Overall, the purpose of this review is to better understand the relevant mechanistic pathways and explore epidemiological investigations in order to establish that phytosterols may contribute to the activation of NRs as cancer drivers in hormone-dependent cancers.",Breast cancer;Hormone-dependent cancers;Nuclear receptors;Phytosterols;Prostate cancer;Steroid hormone receptors;Vegetarian diets,diabetes

Development of a model for predicting acute cerebral infarction induced by non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,"To evaluate the risk factors for acute cerebral infarction(ACI) in patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding(NVUGIB), and construct a model for predicting ACI in NVUGIB patients. A model for predicting ACI induced by NVUGIB was established on the basis of a retrospective study that involved 1282 patients who were diagnosed with NVUGIB in the emergency department and Gastroenterology Department of Nanchang University Affiliated Ganzhou Hospital from January 2019 to December 2021. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the model and CHA2DS2-VASc score to predict ACI. Delong's test was used to compare AUCs of the present score and the CHA2DS2-VASc score. There were 1282 patients enrolled in the study, including 69 in the ACI group and 1213 in the non-ACI group. Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension, diabetes, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, mechanical ventilation, D-dimer, rate pressure product (RPP), somatostatin and mean platelet volume (MPV) were factors associated with ACI induced by NVUGIB. A model based on the eight factors was established, Logit(P)= 0.265 + 1.382 × 1 + 1.120 × 2 + 1.769 × 3 + 0.839 × 4-1.549 × 5-0.361 × 6 + 0.045 × 7 + 1.158 × 8(or 1.069 ×9) (X1, hypertension=1; X2, diabetes=1; X3, RBC transfusion=1; X4, mechanical ventilation=1; X5, somatostatin=1; X6, MPV(fL); X7, D-dimer(ng/l); X8, low RPP= 1; X9, high RPP = 2). The area under ROC curve of the model was 0.873, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.768 and 0.887, respectively. The area under ROC curve of CHA2DS2-VASc score was 0.792, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.728 and 0.716, respectively. Delong's test showed the area under ROC curve of the present study was significantly larger than that of CHA2DS2-VASc score. Hypertension, diabetes, RBC transfusion, mechanical ventilation, D-dimer, RPP, somatostatin and MPV were factors associated with ACI induced by NVUGIB. A model constructed based on these factors showed excellent prediction of ACI, and was superior to CHA2DS2-VASc score.

Common and specific proteins and pathways in heart and cerebral ischemia.,"To understand the similarities and differences between acute ischemic stroke and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to help in the development of specific or common treatment strategies. Using an aptamer-based proteomic array, we measured and compared 1310 circulating proteins in the blood of 40 patients with AIS, 9 patients with AMI, and 31 healthy controls. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using GSEA and g:profiler. Ninety-four proteins were differentially expressed in AIS, and 284 were differentially expressed in AMI. Of these, 8 were specific to cerebral ischemia, and 197 were specific to myocardial infarction. Forty-two proteins were altered in both ischemia processes. Most altered pathways in AIS could be classified as immune response, cell cycle processing, molecular transport, or signaling. Pathways altered in AMI were mostly related to lipid metabolism and transport, highlighting cholesterol metabolic processes and estrogen signaling. In both types of ischemia, we found pathways related to metabolism, specifically purine metabolism, and signaling processes, such as TNF signaling or MAPK1/3. The present study revealed proteins and pathways that were specifically altered in cerebral ischemia, in cardiac ischemia, or in both diseases, providing information on the similarities and differences of ischemic conditions. The role of common and specific proteins and pathways should be explored in detail to find possible therapeutic targets.",Acute myocardial infarct;Cerebral ischemia;Heart ischemia;Ischemic stroke;Proteomic array;proteins,diabetes
"Risk Factors, Trends, and Outcomes Associated With Postpartum Sepsis Readmissions.","To evaluate the prevalence, timing, clinical risk factors, and adverse outcomes associated with postpartum readmissions for maternal sepsis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of delivery hospitalizations and 60-day postpartum readmissions for females aged 15-54 years with and without sepsis using the 2016-2020 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Temporal trends in sepsis diagnoses during delivery hospitalizations and 60-day postpartum readmissions were analyzed with the National Cancer Institute's Joinpoint Regression Program to estimate the average annual percent change with 95% CIs. Logistic regression models were fit to determine whether delivery hospitalization characteristics were associated with postpartum sepsis readmissions, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs were reported. Adverse outcomes associated with sepsis during delivery hospitalization and readmission were described, including death, severe morbidity, a critical care composite, and renal failure. Overall, 15,268,190 delivery hospitalizations and 256,216 associated 60-day readmissions were included after population weighting, of which 16,399 (1.1/1,000 delivery hospitalizations) had an associated diagnosis of sepsis at delivery, and 20,130 (1.3/1,000 delivery hospitalizations) had an associated diagnosis of sepsis with postpartum readmission. A sepsis diagnosis was present in 7.9% of all postpartum readmissions. Characteristics associated with postpartum sepsis readmission included younger age at delivery, Medicaid insurance, lowest median ZIP code income quartile, and chronic medical conditions such as obesity, pregestational diabetes, and chronic hypertension. Postpartum sepsis readmissions were associated with infection during the delivery hospitalization, including intra-amniotic infection or endometritis, wound infection, and delivery sepsis. Sepsis diagnoses were associated with 24.4% of maternal deaths at delivery and 38.4% postpartum, 2.2% cases of nontransfusion severe morbidity excluding sepsis at delivery and 13.6% postpartum, 15.6% of critical care composite diagnoses at delivery and 30.1% postpartum, and 11.1% of acute renal failure diagnoses at delivery and 36.4% postpartum. Sepsis accounts for a significant proportion of postpartum readmissions and is a major contributor to adverse outcomes during delivery hospitalizations and postpartum readmissions.",,diabetes
Duration Of Dual Antiplatelet Treatment After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention In Patients With Diabetes: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis.,"Aim of our systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare shortened (≤3 months) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with longer DAPT in diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).We systematically screened three major databases (Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus) searching for randomized-controlled trials or sub-analyses of them, which compared shortened (S-DAPT) to longer (L-DAPT) regimens of DAPT. Primary endpoint of systematic review and meta-analysis is the NACE (Net Adverse Cardiac Events) and secondary are MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events), mortality, bleedings, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. Subgroup analyses included studies using only ticagrelor-based regimens and three-months duration of DAPT.A total of eight studies and 12,665 patients were included in our analysis. Our meta-analysis met its primary endpoint, as S-DAPT was associated significantly with a reduced risk ratio (RR) by 17% [RR: 0.83, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 0.72-0.96]. Non-significant difference among the rest endpoints was detected between the two groups. Subgroup analyses showed that ticagrelor-based regimens were associated with a significant reduction of mortality (RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48-0.93) and three-months DAPT reduced furtherly NACE by 27% (RR:0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.89).In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that (i) S-DAPT was significantly associated with a lower incidence of NACE, (ii) ticagrelor-based S-DAPT was associated with decreased mortality rates, and (iii) the benefit of three-months duration of DAPT achieved an even greater NACE reduction. Thus, S-DAPT could be considered as a safe and feasible option in diabetic patients.",,diabetes
Diabetes Group Prenatal Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"To estimate the effect of diabetes group prenatal care on rates of preterm birth and large for gestational age (LGA) among patients with diabetes in pregnancy compared with individual diabetes prenatal care. We searched Ovid Medline (1946-), Embase.com (1947-), Scopus (1823-), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing diabetes group prenatal care with individual care among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The primary outcomes were preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation and LGA (birth weight at or above the 90th percentile). Secondary outcomes were small for gestational age, cesarean delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal intensive care unit admission, breastfeeding at hospital discharge, long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) uptake, and 6-week postpartum visit attendance. Secondary outcomes, limited to the subgroup of patients with GDM, included rates of GDM requiring diabetes medication (A2GDM) and completion of postpartum oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test and I2 statistic. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and weighted mean differences. Eight studies met study criteria and were included in the final analysis: three RCTs and five observational studies. A total of 1,701 patients were included in the pooled studies: 770 (45.3%) in diabetes group prenatal care and 931 (54.7%) in individual care. Patients in diabetes group prenatal care had similar rates of preterm birth compared with patients in individual care (seven studies: pooled rates 9.5% diabetes group prenatal care vs 11.5% individual care, pooled RR 0.77, 95% CI, 0.59-1.01), which held for RCTs and observational studies. There was no difference between diabetes group prenatal care and individual care in rates of LGA overall (four studies: pooled rate 16.7% diabetes group prenatal care vs 20.2% individual care, pooled RR 0.93, 95% CI, 0.59-1.45) or by study type. Rates of other secondary outcomes were similar between diabetes group prenatal care and individual care, except patients in diabetes group prenatal care were more likely to receive postpartum LARC (three studies: pooled rates 46.1% diabetes group prenatal care vs 34.1% individual care, pooled RR 1.44, 95% CI, 1.09-1.91). When analysis was limited to patients with GDM, there were no differences in rates of A2GDM or postpartum visit attendance, but patients in diabetes group prenatal care were significantly more likely to complete postpartum OGTT (five studies: pooled rate 74.0% diabetes group prenatal care vs 49.4% individual care, pooled RR 1.58, 95% CI, 1.19-2.09). Patients with type 2 diabetes and GDM who participate in diabetes group prenatal care have similar rates of preterm birth, LGA, and other pregnancy outcomes compared with those who participate in individual care; however, they are significantly more likely to receive postpartum LARC, and those with GDM are more likely to return for postpartum OGTT.

Standardized in vitro Models of Human Adipose Tissue Reveal Metabolic Flexibility in Brown Adipocyte Thermogenesis.,"Functional human brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT) are vital for thermoregulation and nutritional homeostasis, while obesity and other stressors lead, respectively, to cold intolerance and metabolic disease. Understanding BAT and WAT physiology and dysfunction necessitates clinical trials complemented by mechanistic experiments at the cellular level. These require standardized in vitro models, currently lacking, that establish references for gene expression and function. In response, we generated and characterized a pair of immortalized, clonal human brown (hBA) and white (hWA) preadipocytes derived from the perirenal and subcutaneous depots, respectively, of a 40-year-old male. Cells were immortalized with hTERT and confirmed to be of a mesenchymal, non-hematopoietic lineage based on FACS sorting and DNA barcoding. Functional assessments showed that the hWA and hBA phenocopied primary adipocytes in terms of adrenergic signaling, lipolysis, and thermogenesis. Compared to hWA, the hBA were metabolically distinct, with higher rates of glucose uptake, lactate metabolism, and greater basal, maximal, and non-mitochondrial respiration, which provide a mechanistic explanation for the association between obesity and BAT dysfunction. hBA also responded to the stress of maximal respiration by using both endogenous and exogenous fatty acids. In contrast to certain mouse models, hBA adrenergic thermogenesis was mediated by several mechanisms, not principally via uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Transcriptomics via RNA-seq were consistent with the functional studies and established a molecular signature for each cell type before and after differentiation. These standardized cells are anticipated to become a common resource for future physiological, pharmacological, and genetic studies of human adipocytes.",bioenergetics;bioinformatics;brown adipose tissue;in vitro model;white adipose tissue,diabetes
Effects of Metabolic Syndrome and Its Components on Chronic Kidney Disease and Renal Function: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"The association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal function remains controversial in observational studies. To comprehensively investigate the association between MetS and its components with CKD and renal function, a Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed.  The inverse variance weighting (IVW) of random effects was used as the main estimation method, while MR-Egger and weighted median analysis results were used for auxiliary judgments. Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots were used to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy.  The MR analyses of genetically predicted MetS and its components' association with CKD risk and renal function showed the following causal associations: hypertension with CKD risk; MetS and obesity with increased blood urea nitrogen and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C; hypertension and diabetes with increased urine albumin-creatinine ratio and increased risk of microalbuminuria; and CKD with increased triglyceride.  Based on genetic data, this study demonstrated an association between hypertension and CKD risk and a causal association between other MetS components and renal function. The early diagnosis and prevention of MetS and its components might be essential for CKD management.",Mendelian randomization;chronic kidney disease;metabolic syndrome;metabolic syndrome components;renal function,diabetes

Geometric and topological characterization of the cytoarchitecture of islets of Langerhans.,"The islets of Langerhans are critical endocrine micro-organs that secrete hormones regulating energy metabolism in animals. Insulin and glucagon, secreted by beta and alpha cells, respectively, are responsible for metabolic switching between fat and glucose utilization. Dysfunction in their secretion and/or counter-regulatory influence leads to diabetes. Debate in the field centers on the cytoarchitecture of islets, as the signaling that governs hormonal secretion depends on structural and functional factors, including electrical connectivity, innervation, vascularization, and physical proximity. Much effort has therefore been devoted to elucidating which architectural features are significant for function and how derangements in these features are correlated or causative for dysfunction, especially using quantitative network science or graph theory characterizations. Here, we ask if there are non-local features in islet cytoarchitecture, going beyond standard network statistics, that are relevant to islet function. An example is ring structures, or cycles, of α and δ cells surrounding β cell clusters or the opposite, β cells surrounding α and δ cells. These could appear in two-dimensional islet section images if a sphere consisting of one cell type surrounds a cluster of another cell type. To address these issues, we developed two independent computational approaches, geometric and topological, for such characterizations. For the latter, we introduce an application of topological data analysis to determine locations of topological features that are biologically significant. We show that both approaches, applied to a large collection of islet sections, are in complete agreement in the context both of developmental and diabetes-related changes in islet characteristics. The topological approach can be applied to three-dimensional imaging data for islets as well.",,diabetes
Nature and type of patient-reported safety incidents at a tertiary hospital in South Africa during the COVID-19 period (2018-2021)- A retrospective review.,"The healthcare sector in South Africa has seen a rise in medical errors and negligence adversely affecting healthcare delivery. This study aimed to determine the nature and magnitude of Patient Safety Incidents at a tertiary hospital between April 2018 to March 2021 (the COVID-19 era). A retrospective review of Patient Safety Incidents forms and clinical records of inpatients above 12 years with a reported incident were included. The overall incidence of patient safety incidents was 4.40 PSIs per 10 000 patient-days. The majority of PSIs were harmful incidents (An incident that results in harm to a patient that is related to medical management, in contrast to disease complications or underlying disease) at 72.50% [145/200], followed by no harm incidents at 18.00% [36/200] and 9.50% [19/200] near-miss incidents. The five highest incident types were clinical process/procedure [83/200; 41.50%], behaviour [49/200; 24.50%], falls [28/200; 14%], complications [20/200; 10%], and pressure sores [11/200; 5.50%]. Incidents occurred more frequently within the week (83.50%) and during day shift (67.50%). Overall, the study showed low PSI reporting rates which is an inherent challenge with voluntary reporting. Notably, there has been an increasing trend in reporting. The results reflect a reporting culture more inclined to bring awareness to incidents that have negative outcomes.",,diabetes
In Silico identification of novel phytochemicals that target SFRP4: An early biomarker of diabesity.,"The simultaneous coexistence of complicated metabolic conditions like obesity and diabetes within an individual is known as diabesity. Obesity is the key factor for many chronic diseases, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Metabolic stress due to nutrient overload releases different inflammatory mediators. Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is also an inflammatory mediator that impairs insulin secretion. SFRP4 acts as an early biomarker for diabesity expressed with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in the adipose tissues that hinder the exocytosis of insulin-secreting granules from the pancreatic β-cells and is a potential target for preserving β-cell dysfunction and the diabesity treatment. The current study aimed to screen potential bioactive compounds targeting and inhibiting the diabesity-linked SFRP4 protein through an in silico approach. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of human SFRP4 was predicted through comparative modeling techniques and evaluated by various online bioinformatics tools. The molecular docking and MD simulation investigations were carried out against phytochemicals with anti-diabetic and anti-obesity properties to shortlist the best SFRP4 inhibitor. Hesperetin, Curcumin, Isorhamnetin, Embelin, Epicatechin, and Methyl Eugenol interacted strongly with SFRP4 by displaying zero RMSD and binding affinities of -6.5, -6.4, -6.3, -5.3, -6.3 and -5.8 kcal/mol respectively. Additionally, the root mean square fluctuation and root mean square deviation graphs from the MD simulation results demonstrated that hesperetin has good variations throughout the simulation period as compared to others. This dynamic stability and control behavior of hesperetin, when it interacts with SFRP4, shows that it has the potential to modulate the function and activity of the protein. Therefore, hesperetin is identified as an effective and top drug candidate through this analysis for preserving beta-cell function and treating diabesity by targeting SFRP4. The findings of this study could be useful in the design and development of diabesity drugs.",,diabetes
Improved meta-analysis pipeline ameliorates distinctive gene regulators of diabetic vasculopathy in human endothelial cell (hECs) RNA-Seq data.,"Enormous gene expression data generated through next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are accessible to the scientific community via public repositories. The data harboured in these repositories are foundational for data integrative studies enabling large-scale data analysis whose potential is yet to be fully realized. Prudent integration of individual gene expression data i.e. RNA-Seq datasets is remarkably challenging as it encompasses an assortment and series of data analysis steps that requires to be accomplished before arriving at meaningful insights on biological interrogations. These insights are at all times latent within the data and are not usually revealed from the modest individual data analysis owing to the limited number of biological samples in individual studies. Nevertheless, a sensibly designed meta-analysis of select individual studies would not only maximize the sample size of the analysis but also significantly improves the statistical power of analysis thereby revealing the latent insights. In the present study, a custom-built meta-analysis pipeline is presented for the integration of multiple datasets from different origins. As a case study, we have tested with the integration of two relevant datasets pertaining to diabetic vasculopathy retrieved from the open source domain. We report the meta-analysis ameliorated distinctive and latent gene regulators of diabetic vasculopathy and uncovered a total of 975 i.e. 930 up-regulated and 45 down-regulated gene signatures. Further investigation revealed a subset of 14 DEGs including CTLA4, CALR, G0S2, CALCR, OMA1, and DNAJC3 as latent i.e. novel as these signatures have not been reported earlier. Moreover, downstream investigations including enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of DEGs revealed durable disease association signifying their potential as novel transcriptomic biomarkers of diabetic vasculopathy. While the meta-analysis of individual whole transcriptomic datasets for diabetic vasculopathy is exclusive to our comprehension, however, the novel meta-analysis pipeline could very well be extended to study the mechanistic links of DEGs in other disease conditions.",,diabetes
Pharmacophore mapping approach to find anti-cancer phytochemicals with metformin-like activities against transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor I kinase: An in silico study.,"The most frequently prescribed first-line treatment for type II diabetes mellitus is metformin. Recent reports asserted that this diabetes medication can also shield users from cancer. Metformin induces cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. However, the exact mechanism by which this occurs in the cancer system is yet to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the impact of metformin on cell cycle arrest in cancer cells utilizing transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pathway. TGF-ß pathway has significant effect on cell progression and growth. In order to gain an insight on the underlying molecular mechanism of metformin's effect on TGF beta receptor 1 kinase, molecular docking was performed. Metformin was predicted to interact with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor I kinase based on molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, pharmacophore was generated for metformin-TGF-ßR1 complex to hunt for novel compounds having similar pharmacophore as metformin with enhanced anti-cancer potentials. Virtual screening with 29,000 natural compounds from NPASS database was conducted separately for the generated pharmacophores in Ligandscout® software. Pharmacophore mapping showed 60 lead compounds for metformin-TGF-ßR1 complex. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation for 100 ns and ADMET analysis were performed on these compounds. Compounds with CID 72473, 10316977 and 45140078 showed promising binding affinities and formed stable complexes during dynamics simulation with aforementioned protein and thus have potentiality to be developed into anti-cancer medicaments.",,diabetes
Impact of Geography and Rurality on Preconception Health Status in the United States.,"Maternal illness and death are largely preventable; however, the field of preconception health needs further study. Geographic region and rurality play a large role in maternal health, and an understanding of the effect of these 2 factors at the individual level could prevent future adverse maternal health outcomes. We developed an abbreviated index of preconception health risk (diabetes, hypertension, body weight, mental health, unintended pregnancy, HIV, alcohol and nicotine use, nutrition, physical activity, receipt of the influenza vaccine) by using data from the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). A score of 1 was assigned for each behavior factor classified as unhealthy and a score of 0 for each factor classified as healthy, for a total potential score of 11. Respondent women from the 37 states that included the BRFSS family planning supplemental module who were aged 18 to 44 years who could become pregnant (N = 25,999) were included. We used univariate and multivariate regression models to assess the relationship between sociodemographic factors (age, race or ethnicity, relationship status, insurance status, education, income, and rurality and region) and preconception health, with a primary focus on rurality and region. The average preconception health risk index score among participants was 3.5, with higher average scores in rural areas than in urban areas. All factors were independently associated with preconception health. Compared with women living in the urban Northeast, women living in all rural and region groups, except the rural West, had increased preconception health risk. Preconception health scores from our study showed that, on average, a person had more than 3 risk factors or behaviors. Given the current state of reproductive health policy in the United States, increased efforts are needed to address preconception health.",,diabetes
Temporal Immunomodulation via Wireless Programmed Electric Cues Achieves Optimized Diabetic Bone Regeneration.,"Mimicking the temporal pattern of biological behaviors during the natural repair process is a promising strategy for biomaterial-mediated tissue regeneration. However, precise regulation of dynamic cell behaviors allocated in a microenvironment post-implantation remains challenging until now. Here, remote tuning of electric cues is accomplished by wireless ultrasound stimulation (US) on an electroactive membrane for bone regeneration under a diabetic background. Programmable electric cues mediated by US from the piezoelectric membrane achieve the temporal regulation of macrophage polarization, satisfying the pattern of immunoregulation during the natural healing process and effectively promoting diabetic bone repair. Mechanistic insight reveals that the controllable decrease in AKT2 expression and phosphorylation could explain US-mediated macrophage polarization. This study exhibits a strategy aimed at precisely biosimulating the temporal regenerative pattern by controllable and programmable electric output for optimized diabetic tissue regeneration and provides basic insights into bionic design-based precision medicine achieved by intelligent and external field-responsive biomaterials.",diabetic bone defect;improved bone regeneration;piezoelectric membranes;temporal immunomodulation;wireless electric cues,diabetes

In diabetes, robust biosensing technologies and automated insulin delivery therapies have created a substantial opportunity to improve health. While the number of manuscripts addressing the topic of applying machine learning to diabetes has grown in recent years, there has been a lack of consistency in the methods, metrics, and data used to train and evaluate these algorithms. This manuscript provides consensus guidelines for machine learning practitioners in the field of diabetes, including best practice recommended approaches and warnings about pitfalls to avoid. Algorithmic approaches are reviewed and benefits of different algorithms are discussed including importance of clinical accuracy, explainability, interpretability, and personalization. We review the most common features used in machine learning applications in diabetes glucose control and provide an open-source library of functions for calculating features, as well as a framework for specifying data sets using data sheets. A review of current data sets available for training algorithms is provided as well as an online repository of data sources.

HNF1α maintains pancreatic α and β cell functions in primary human islets.,"HNF1A haploinsufficiency underlies the most common form of human monogenic diabetes (HNF1A-MODY) and hypomorphic HNF1A variants confer type 2 diabetes risk, but a lack of experimental systems for interrogating mature human islets has limited our understanding of how the transcription factor HNF1α regulates adult islet function. Here, we combined conditional genetic targeting in human islet cells, RNA sequencing, chromatin mapping with Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), and transplantation-based assays to determine HNF1α-regulated mechanisms in adult human pancreatic α and β cells. Short hairpin RNA-mediated (shRNA) suppression of HNF1A in primary human pseudoislets led to blunted insulin output and dysregulated glucagon secretion after transplantation in mice, recapitulating phenotypes observed in diabetic patients. These deficits corresponded with altered expression of genes encoding factors critical for hormone secretion, including calcium channel subunits, ATPase transporters and extracellular matrix constituents. Additionally, HNF1A loss led to upregulation of transcriptional repressors, providing evidence for a mechanism of transcriptional de-repression through HNF1α. CUT&RUN mapping of HNF1α DNA-binding sites in primary human islets imputed a subset of HNF1α-regulated genes as direct targets. These data elucidate mechanistic links between HNF1A loss and diabetic phenotypes in mature human α and β cells.",Beta cells;Diabetes;Endocrinology;Genetics;Monogenic diseases,diabetes
Independent and Interactive Associations of Subjective and Objective Socioeconomic Status With Body Composition and Parent-Reported Hyperphagia Among Children.,"Subjective socioeconomic status (SSES) and objective socioeconomic status (OSES) have been independently associated with body composition and eating behavior in children. While low OSES may constrain access to healthier foods, low SSES has been associated with increased preference for and motivation to consume higher energy foods and portions independent of OSES. Despite these distinct ways that OSES and SSES may affect children's eating behavior and adiposity, their joint contributions remain unclear. We investigated the independent and interactive associations of SSES and OSES with children's BMI, fat mass index (FMI), and caregiver-reported hyperphagia.  Data were derived from the Children's Growth and Behavior Study, an ongoing observational study. Multiple linear regressions used child's SSES and OSES of the family as independent factors and modeled the statistical interaction of SSES and OSES with BMI (n = 128), FMI (n = 122), and hyperphagia and its subscales (n = 76) as dependent variables.  SSES was independently and negatively associated with hyperphagia severity and OSES was independently and negatively associated with both FMI and hyperphagia severity. There was a statistical interaction effect of SSES and OSES on hyperphagia severity-lower SSES was associated with greater hyperphagia severity only at lower levels of OSES.  These findings demonstrate a relationship between low OSES and child adiposity and that the relationship between child SSES and hyperphagia severity may be most relevant for children from households with lower family OSES. Future research on socioeconomic disparities in children's body composition and eating behaviors should examine the interaction of SSES and OSES.

An AI Dietitian for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Management Based on Large Language and Image Recognition Models: Preclinical Concept Validation Study.,"Nutritional management for patients with diabetes in China is a significant challenge due to the low supply of registered clinical dietitians. To address this, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based nutritionist program that uses advanced language and image recognition models was created. This program can identify ingredients from images of a patient's meal and offer nutritional guidance and dietary recommendations. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the competence of the models that support this program. The potential of an AI nutritionist program for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was evaluated through a multistep process. First, a survey was conducted among patients with T2DM and endocrinologists to identify knowledge gaps in dietary practices. ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 were then tested through the Chinese Registered Dietitian Examination to assess their proficiency in providing evidence-based dietary advice. ChatGPT's responses to common questions about medical nutrition therapy were compared with expert responses by professional dietitians to evaluate its proficiency. The model's food recommendations were scrutinized for consistency with expert advice. A deep learning-based image recognition model was developed for food identification at the ingredient level, and its performance was compared with existing models. Finally, a user-friendly app was developed, integrating the capabilities of language and image recognition models to potentially improve care for patients with T2DM. Most patients (182/206, 88.4%) demanded more immediate and comprehensive nutritional management and education. Both ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 passed the Chinese Registered Dietitian examination. ChatGPT's food recommendations were mainly in line with best practices, except for certain foods like root vegetables and dry beans. Professional dietitians' reviews of ChatGPT's responses to common questions were largely positive, with 162 out of 168 providing favorable reviews. The multilabel image recognition model evaluation showed that the Dino V2 model achieved an average F1 score of 0.825, indicating high accuracy in recognizing ingredients. The model evaluations were promising. The AI-based nutritionist program is now ready for a supervised pilot study.","D006801:Humans;D064686:Nutritionists;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D001185:Artificial Intelligence;D010865:Pilot Projects;D007802:Language;D062407:Meals",diabetes
A randomised controlled trial assessing the impact of CGM with a predictive hypoglycaemia alert function on hypoglycaemia in physical activity for people with type 1 diabetes (PACE).,"Background Uptake of exercise in people with Type 1 Diabetes is low despite significant health benefits. Fear of hypoglycaemia is the main barrier to exercise. Continuous glucose monitoring with predictive alarms warning of impending hypoglycaemia may improve self-management of diabetes around exercise. Aim To assess the impact of Dexcom G6 real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system with a predictive hypoglycaemia alert function on the frequency, duration and severity of hypoglycaemia occurring during and after regular (150min/week) physical activity in people with T1D. Methods After 10 days of blinded run-in (Baseline), CGM was unblinded and participants randomised 1:1 to have the ""urgent low soon"" (ULS) alert switched 'on' or 'off' for 40 days. Participants then switched alerts 'off' or 'on' respectively for a further 40 days. Physical activity, carbohydrate and insulin doses were recorded. Results Twenty-four participants (8 men, 16 women) were randomised. There was no difference in change from baseline of hypoglycaemia <3.0 and <3.9mmol/L with the ULS on or off during the 24 hours after exercise. With ULS alert 'on' time spent below 2.8mmol/L compared to baseline was significantly (p=0.04) lower than with ULS 'off' in the 24 hours after exercise. In mixed effects regression, timing of the exercise and baseline HbA1c independently affected risk of hypoglycaemia during exercise; exercise timing also affected hypoglycaemia risk after exercise. Conclusion A CGM device with an Urgent Low Soon alert reduces exposure to hypoglycaemia below 2.8mmol/l overall and in the 24 hours after exercise compared to a threshold alert.",,diabetes
Development of an Automated Electroretinography Analysis Approach.,"Electroretinography (ERG) is used to assess retinal function in ophthalmology clinics and animal models of ocular disease; however, analyzing ERG waveforms can be a time-intensive process with interobserver variability. We developed ERGAssist, an automated approach, to perform non-subjective and repeatable feature identification (""marking"") of the ERG waveform. The automated approach denoised the recorded waveforms and then located the b-wave after applying a lowpass filter. If an a-wave was present, the lowpass filter wave was also used to help locate the a-wave, which was considered the initial large negative response after the flash stimuli. Oscillatory potentials (OPs) were found using a bandpass filter on the denoised waveform. We used two cohorts. One was a Coherence cohort that consisted of ERGs with eight dark-adapted and three light-adapted stimuli in Brown Norway rats (-6 to 1.5 log cd·s/m2). The Verification cohort consisted of control and diabetic (DM) Long Evans rats. We examined retinal function using a five-step dark-adapted protocol (-3 to 1.9 log cd·s/m2). ERGAssist showed a strong correlation with manual markings of ERG features in our Coherence dataset, including the amplitudes (a-wave: r2 = 0.99; b-wave: r2 = 0.99; OP: r2 = 0.92) and implicit times (a-wave: r2 = 0.96; b-wave: r2 = 0.90; OP: r2 = 0.96). In the Verification cohort, both approaches detected differences between control and DM animals and found longer OP implicit times (P < 0.0001) in DM animals. These results provide verification of ERGAssist to identify features of the full-field ERG. This ERG analysis approach can increase the rigor of basic science studies designed to investigate retinal function using full-field ERG. To aid the community, we have developed an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) implementing the methods presented.","D006801:Humans;D051381:Rats;D000818:Animals;D020318:Rats, Long-Evans;D004596:Electroretinography;D012160:Retina;D011914:Rats, Inbred BN",diabetes
"Efficacy and Safety of Mazdutide in Chinese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Trial.","We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mazdutide, a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucagon receptor dual agonist, in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. Adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone or with stable metformin (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 7.0-10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol]) were randomly assigned to receive 3 mg mazdutide (n = 51), 4.5 mg mazdutide (n = 49), 6 mg mazdutide (n = 49), 1.5 mg open-label dulaglutide (n = 50), or placebo (n = 51) subcutaneously for 20 weeks. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 20. Mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to week 20 ranged from -1.41% to -1.67% with mazdutide (-1.35% with dulaglutide and 0.03% with placebo; all P < 0.0001 vs. placebo). Mean percent changes in body weight from baseline to week 20 were dose dependent and up to -7.1% with mazdutide (-2.7% with dulaglutide and -1.4% with placebo). At week 20, participants receiving mazdutide were more likely to achieve HbA1c targets of <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and ≤6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and body weight loss from baseline of ≥5% and ≥10% compared with placebo-treated participants. The most common adverse events with mazdutide included diarrhea (36%), decreased appetite (29%), nausea (23%), vomiting (14%), and hypoglycemia (10% [8% with placebo]). In Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes, mazdutide dosed up to 6 mg was generally safe and demonstrated clinically meaningful HbA1c and body weight reductions.",,diabetes
A Cost Analysis of Rethink the Strip: De-implementing a Low-value Practice in Primary Care.,"Routine self-monitoring of blood glucose is a low-value practice that provides limited benefit for patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus. We estimated the costs of Rethink the Strip (RTS), a multistrategy approach to the de-implementation of self-monitoring of blood glucose in primary care. RTS was conducted among 20 primary care clinics in North Carolina. We estimated the non-site-based and site-based costs of the 5 RTS strategies (practice facilitation, audit and feedback, provider champions, educational meetings, and educational materials) from the analytic perspective of an integrated health care system for 12 and 27-month time horizons. Material costs were tracked through project records, and personnel costs were assessed using activity-based costing. We used nationally based wage estimates. Total RTS costs equaled $68,941 for 12 months. Specifically, non-site-based costs comprised $16,560. Most non-site-based costs ($11,822) were from the foundational programming and coding updates to the electronic health record data to develop the audit and feedback reports. The non-site-based costs of educational meetings, practice facilitation, and educational materials were substantially lower, ranging between ~$400 and $1000. Total 12-month site-based costs equaled $2569 for a single clinic (or $52,381 for 20 clinics). Educational meetings were the most expensive strategy, averaging $1401 per clinic. The site-based costs for the 4 other implementation strategies were markedly lower, ranging between $51 for educational materials and $555 for practice facilitation per clinic. This study provides detailed cost information for implementation strategies used to support evidence-based programs in primary care clinics.","D006801:Humans;D001786:Blood Glucose;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D003365:Costs and Cost Analysis;D004522:Educational Status;D011320:Primary Health Care",diabetes
No Incidence of Liver Cancer Was Observed in A Retrospective Study of Patients with Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy.,"To assess the risk of aristolochic acid (AA)-associated cancer in patients with AA nephropathy (AAN). A retrospective study was conducted on patients diagnosed with AAN at Peking University First Hospital from January 1997 to December 2014. Long-term surveillance and follow-up data were analyzed to investigate the influence of different factors on the prevalence of cancer. The primary endpoint was the incidence of liver cancer, and the secondary endpoint was the incidence of urinary cancer during 1 year after taking AA-containing medication to 2014. A total of 337 patients diagnosed with AAN were included in this study. From the initiation of taking AA to the termination of follow-up, 39 patients were diagnosed with cancer. No cases of liver cancer were observed throughout the entire follow-up period, with urinary cancer being the predominant type (34/39, 87.17%). Logistic regression analysis showed that age, follow-up period, and diabetes were potential risk factors, however, the dosage of the drug was not significantly associated with urinary cancer. No cases of liver cancer were observed at the end of follow-up. However, a high prevalence of urinary cancer was observed in AAN patients.

Long-Term Quantitative Analysis of Inner Retinal Dimples and Visual Function Post Internal Limiting Membrane Peeling in Macular Diseases.,"Inner retinal dimples (IRDs) are frequently detected after internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling. However, the distribution of IRDs and its effect on postoperative visual function remain unclear. We aim to quantify the distribution of IRDs after ILM peeling in different macular diseases and analyze its influence on postoperative visual function. We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing vitrectomy with ILM peeling and followed up until 12 months in our center. The distribution of IRDs were quantitatively determined using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography in a different sector of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid. Visual function was evaluated by retinal sensitivity (RS) using microperimetry. Spearman correlation was performed between RS and IRDs within the same sectors. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between baseline characteristics and IRDs. A total of 43 idiopathic macular hole (iMH) cases, 56 idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM) cases and 42 myopic foveoschisis (mFS) cases were included. IRDs increased gradually at ILM-peeled area, interrupting ganglion cell layer. Most IRDs were observed in temporal sector. A negative correlation was depicted between the increase of IRDs and the progress of RS at both perifovea and parafovea in iERM, but only at perifovea in iMH. No significant correlation between the change of IRDs and RS was found in mFS. Multivariable linear regression model showed that preoperative axial length was significantly associated with postoperative IRDs in all patients. IRDs distributed mostly at temporal sector after ILM peeling, interrupting ganglion cell layer. IRD progression may influence postoperative RS only in iMH and iERM. Ophthalmologists may avoid temporal sector especially in eyes with normal axial length or strong ILM-ERM adherence.",Inner retinal dimples;Internal limiting membrane;Retinal sensitivity;Temporal,diabetes
Potential Underlying Mechanisms Explaining the Cardiorenal Benefits of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors.,"There is a bidirectional pathophysiological interaction between the heart and the kidneys, and prolonged physiological stress to the heart and/or the kidneys can cause adverse cardiorenal complications, including but not limited to subclinical cardiomyopathy, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Whilst more common in individuals with Type 2 diabetes, cardiorenal complications also occur in the absence of diabetes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were initially approved to reduce hyperglycaemia in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Recently, these agents have been shown to significantly improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with and without Type 2 diabetes, demonstrating a robust reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure and reduced risk of progression of chronic kidney disease, thus gaining approval for use in treatment of heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Numerous potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiorenal effects of SGLT2i. This review provides a simplified summary of key potential cardiac and renal mechanisms underlying the cardiorenal benefits of SGT2i and explains these mechanisms in the clinical context. Key mechanisms related to the clinical effects of SGLT2i on the heart and kidneys explained in this publication include their impact on (1) tissue oxygen delivery, hypoxia and resultant ischaemic injury, (2) vascular health and function, (3) substrate utilisation and metabolic health and (4) cardiac remodelling. Knowing the mechanisms responsible for SGLT2i-imparted cardiorenal benefits in the clinical outcomes will help healthcare practitioners to identify more patients that can benefit from the use of SGLT2i.",Cardiorenal complications;Cardiorenal protection;Diabetes;SGLT2 inhibitors;SGLT2i mechanisms,diabetes

Tubular TMEM16A promotes tubulointerstitial fibrosis by suppressing PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis in diabetic kidney disease.,"Tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) plays a crucial role in the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. The present study aimed to examine whether transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A), a Ca2+-activated chloride channel, contributes to the development of TIF in DKD. Interestingly, we found that TMEM16A expression was significantly up-regulated in tubule of murine model of DKD, which was associated with development of TIF. In vivo inhibition of TMEM16A channel activity with specific inhibitors Ani9 effectively protects against TIF. Then, we found that TMEM16A activation induces tubular mitochondrial dysfunction in in vivo and in vitro models, with the evidence of the TMEM16A inhibition with specific inhibitor. Mechanically, TMEM16A mediated tubular mitochondrial dysfunction through inhibiting PGC-1α, whereas overexpression of PGC-1α could rescue the changes. In addition, TMEM16A-induced fibrogenesis was dependent on increased intracellular Cl-, and reducing intracellular Cl- significantly blunted high glucose-induced PGC-1α and profibrotic factors expression. Taken together, our studies demonstrated that tubular TMEM16A promotes TIF by suppressing PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis in DKD. Blockade of TMEM16A may serve as a novel therapeutic approach to ameliorate TIF.",D000818:Animals;D051379:Mice;D003928:Diabetic Nephropathies;D006706:Homeostasis;D008928:Mitochondria;D005355:Fibrosis;D003920:Diabetes Mellitus,diabetes
Ethnic and Racial Disparities in the Association between Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Dementia.,"Evidence in the literature suggests an association between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and dementia, but this relationship has not been studied in the most recently available nationally representative datasets. This retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study of adults (60+ years of age) seeks to investigate this association across racial and ethnic groups in the most recently available National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) datasets. A multivariable logistic regression model is employed to investigate the association between T2DM and the diagnosis of dementia and assess disparities in racial and ethnic groups, while controlling for available covariates of interest. The analysis found no evidence of a relationship between T2DM and dementia even after adjusting for available covariates of interest (OR 1.13, 95% CI = 0.81-1.57). However, evidence of differences in the proportion with dementia was observed between ethnicities and race groups. Hispanic/Latinos were found to have more than double the odds of dementia compared to Non-Hispanic/Latinos (OR 2.08, 95% CI = 1.05-4.14), while the Other race group had 74% lower odds of dementia compared to the White race group (OR 0.26, 95% CI = 0.10-0.64). This study suggests that disparities in the risk of dementia remain for ethnic/racial groups. As minority populations continue to grow, educational and preventative measures for both diabetes and dementia are vital public health priorities. Perceptions of cognitive impairment, its association with T2DM, and the interventions needed to address the deficits may vary by culture and ethnic background; therefore, specific characteristics relevant to these populations should be further evaluated.",Cognitive decline;Dementia;Diabetes;Ethnic and racial disparities;Neurocognitive disorder;Type 2 diabetes mellitus,diabetes
Adenosine-induced splenic switch-off on [,"Splenic switch-off (SSO) is a marker of adequate adenosine-induced vasodilatation on cardiac magnetic resonance perfusion imaging. We evaluate the feasibility of quantitative assessment of SSO in myocardial positron emission tomography (PET) perfusion imaging using [15O]H2O. Thirty patients underwent [15O]H2O PET perfusion with adenosine stress. Time-activity curves, as averaged standardized uptake values (SUVavg), were extracted from dynamic PET for spleen and liver. Maximum SUVavg, stress and rest spleen-to-liver ratio (SLR), and the splenic activity concentration ratio (SAR) were computed. Optimal cut-off values for SSO assessment were estimated from receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for maximum SUVavg and SLR. Also, differences between coronary artery disease, myocardial ischemia, beta-blockers, and diabetes were assessed. Data are presented as median [interquartile range]. In concordance with the SSO phenomenon, both the spleen maximum SUVavg and SLR were lower in adenosine stress when compared to rest perfusion (8.1 [6.5, 9.2] versus 16.4 [13.4, 19.0], p < 0.001) and (0.81 [0.63, 1.08] versus 1.86 [1.73, 2.06], p < 0.001), respectively. During adenosine stress, the SSO effect was most prominent 40-160 s after radiotracer injection. Cut-off values of 12.6 and 1.57 for maximum SUVavg and SLR, respectively, were found based on ROC analysis. No differences in SAR, SLRRest, or SLRStress were observed in patients with coronary artery disease, myocardial ischemia, or diabetes. SSO can be quantified from [15O]H2O PET perfusion and used as a marker for adequate adenosine-induced vasodilatation response. In contrary to other PET perfusion tracers, adenosine-induced SSO is time dependent with [15O]H2O.","Adenosine, coronary artery disease;Myocardial perfusion imaging;Positron emission tomography;Radiowater;Stress testing",diabetes
NADH intraperitoneal injection prevents massive pancreatic beta cell destruction in a streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by persistent hyperglycemia, revealing a decrease in insulin efficiency. The sustained glucotoxic pancreatic microenvironment increases reactive oxygen species generation, resulting in chronic oxidative stress responsible for massive DNA damage. This triggers PARP-1 activation with both NAD+ and ATP depletion, affecting drastically pancreatic beta cells' energy storage and leading to their dysfunction and death. The aim of the present study is to highlight the main histological changes observed in pancreatic islets pre-treated with a unique NADH intraperitoneal injection in a streptozotocin-(STZ)-induced diabetes model. In order to adjust NADH doses, a preliminary study with three different doses, 500 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, and 150 mg/kg, respectively, was conducted. Subsequently, and on the basis of the results of the aforementioned study, Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: non-diabetic control group, diabetics (STZ 45 mg/kg), NADH-treated group (150 mg/kg) 15 min before STZ administration, and NADH-treated group (150 mg/kg) 15 min after STZ administration. The effect of NADH was assessed by blood glucose level, TUNEL staining, histo-morphological analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The optimum protective dose of NADH was 150 mg/kg. NADH effectively decreased hyperglycemia and reduced diabetes induced by STZ. Histologically, NADH pre-treatment revealed a decrease in beta cell death favoring apoptosis over necrosis and therefore preventing inflammation with further beta cell destruction. Our data clearly demonstrate that NADH prior or post-treatment could effectively prevent the deleterious loss of beta cell mass in STZ-induced diabetes in rats and preserve the normal pancreatic islet's function.",Insulin efficiency;Islet structure;NADH;Pancreatic beta cells;Streptozotocin injection,diabetes
Real-world experience with ultrasound renal denervation utilizing home blood pressure monitoring: the Global Paradise System registry study design.,"Hypertension is a major public health issue due to its association with cardiovascular disease risk. Despite the availability of effective antihypertensive drugs, rates of blood pressure (BP) control remain suboptimal. Renal denervation (RDN) has emerged as an effective non-pharmacological, device-based treatment option for patients with hypertension. The multicenter, single-arm, observational Global Paradise™ System (GPS) registry has been designed to examine the long-term safety and effectiveness of ultrasound RDN (uRDN) with the Paradise System in a large population of patients with hypertension. The study aims to enroll up to 3000 patients undergoing uRDN in routine clinical practice. Patients will be recruited over a 4-year period and followed for 5 years (at 3, 6, and 12 months after the uRDN procedure and annually thereafter). Standardized home BP measurements will be taken every 3 months with automatic upload to the cloud. Office and ambulatory BP and adverse events will be collected as per routine clinical practice. Quality-of-Life questionnaires will be used to capture patient-reported outcomes. This observational registry will provide real-world information on the safety and effectiveness of uRDN in a large population of patients treated during routine clinical practice, and also allow for a better understanding of responses in prespecified subgroups. The focus on home BP in this registry is expected to improve completeness of long-term follow-up and provide unique insights into BP over time. Global Paradise System registry study design.

Beyond the acute illness: Exploring long COVID and its impact on multiple organ systems.,"Unprecedented worldwide health catastrophe due to the COVID-19 pandemic has ended up resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. Even though many people recover from acute infection, there is rising concern regarding post-COVID-19 conditions (PCCs), often referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or ""long COVID."" The respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrine systems are just a few of the many organ systems that can be impacted by this multifarious, complicated illness. The clinical manifestations of long COVID can vary among individuals and may include fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive impairment, and new-onset diabetes, among others. Although the underlying processes of long COVID are not fully understood, they probably involve unregulated immune response, persistent generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (chronic inflammation), autoimmune-like reactions, persistent viral replication, and micro-clot formation. To create successful treatments and care plans, it is essential to comprehend the immunological mechanisms causing these difficulties. The pathogenesis of long COVID should be clarified and potential biomarkers to help with diagnosis and treatment should be sought after. To reduce the burden of long COVID on people and healthcare systems around the world, the need for long-term monitoring and management of long COVID problems should be emphasized. It also underscores the significance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. The goal of this review is to carefully evaluate the clinical signs and symptoms of long COVID, their underlying causes, and any potential immunological implications.",SARS-CoV-2;long COVID;multiple organ systems;pandemic;post-COVID-19 conditions,diabetes
Hyaluronic Acid-based ROS-responsive Multifunctional Injectable Hydrogel Platform Accelerating Diabetic Wound Healing.,"Diabetic wounds are more likely to develop into complex and severe chronic wounds. The objective of this study is to develop and assess a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive multifunctional injectable hydrogel for the purpose of diabetic wound healing. We successfully synthesized a multifunctional hydrogel (HA@Cur@Ag) with dual antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties by crosslinking thiol hyaluronic acid (SH-HA) and disulfide-bonded hyperbranched polyethylene glycol (HB-PBHE) through Michael addition while incorporating curcumin liposomes and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The HA@Cur@Ag hydrogel exhibited favourable biocompatibility, degradability and injectivity. The outcomes of in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the hydrogel could effectively be loaded with and release curcumin liposomes, as well as silver ions, thereby facilitating diabetic wound healing through multiple mechanisms, including ROS scavenging, bactericidal activity, anti-inflammatory effects, and the promotion of angiogenesis. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that the HA@Cur@Ag hydrogel effectively suppressed the activation of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)/ nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway to ameliorate oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetic wounds. These findings suggested that this ROS-responsive multifunctional injectable hydrogel, which possessed the ability to precisely coordinate and integrate intricate biological and molecular processes involved in wound healing, exhibited notable potential for expediting diabetic wound healing.

Network pharmacology combined with molecular docking and experimental verification to elucidate functional mechanism of Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi against type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ) capsules have been prescribed for treating glucose and lipid metabolism disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, network pharmacology and experimental verification were combined to investigate the mechanisms of FTZ in treating T2DM. A total of 176 active ingredients and 1169 corresponding targets were screened using biological databases. 598 potential targets of T2DM were retrieved from GeneCards, PharmGKB, OMIM, Drugbank, and TTD. The Venn diagram was employed to identify the 194 intersection targets, which were employed to construct the ""Herb-Compound-Target"" interacting networks. These common targets were also used to prepare a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to uncover potential targets. The four core targets were docked to their corresponding targets for binding analysis. Additionally, the top-ranked poses of ingredients and the positive compounds from each protein were evaluated for stability using molecular dynamics. Our results suggest that core active ingredients such as kaempferol, luteolin, and baicalein have high binding affinity and stability with AKT1, PTGS2 (also known as COX-2), DPP4, and PAPRG. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the treatment T2DM by FTZ might be related to different pathway like AMPK and EGFR pathways. The experimental validation results proved that kaempferol, luteolin, and baicalein could significantly inhibit the activity of DPP4 and COX-2, kaempferol and luteolin were also able to activate AKT and AMPK signaling pathway. This study further validated previous findings and enhanced our understanding of the potential effects of FTZ on T2DM.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Long duration of atrial high-rate episode is more favorable in predicting ischemic stroke than high CHA,"This study aimed to explore the roles of duration and burden of atrial high-rate episode (AHRE) on ischemic stroke in patients with pacemaker implantation. Patients with pacemaker implantation for bradycardia from 2013 to 2017 were consecutively enrolled. Data such as gender, age, combined diseases, type of AF, left atrial size, left ventricular size, left ventricular ejection fraction, CHA2 DS2 -VASc score, and anticoagulants were collected. The burden and duration of AHRE based on different interval partition were also recorded in detail to evaluate the impacts on ischemic stroke. Cox regression analysis with time-dependent covariates was conducted. A total of 220 patients with AHRE were enrolled. The average follow-up time was 48.42 ± 17.20 months. Univariate regression analysis showed that diabetes (p = .024), high CHA2 DS2 -VASc score (≥ 2) (p = .021), long mean AHRE burden (p = .011), long maximal AHRE burden (p = .015), long AHRE duration lasting≥48 h (p = .001) or 24 h (p = .001) or 12 h (p = .005) were prone to ischemic stroke. Further multivariate regression analysis showed that long duration of AHRE (≥48 h) (HR 10.77; 95% CI 3.22-55.12; p = .030) were significantly correlated with stroke in patients with paroxysmal AF. There was no significant correlation between the type of AF and stroke (p = .927). The longer duration of AHRE (≥48 h) was more favorable in predicting ischemic stroke than high CHA2 DS2 -VASc score (≥2).",CHA2DS2-VASc score;atrial fibrillation;atrial high-rate event;cardiac implantable electronic device;ischemic stroke,diabetes
The Importance of Assessing Drug Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in the Obese Population During Drug Development.,"Obesity remains a US national health crisis and a growing concern worldwide. Concerningly, individuals who are obese are at an increased risk for comorbid diseases that include, but are not limited to, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Beyond the risk for developing these conditions, obesity may also impact the pharmacological activity of the therapies being used to treat them and other disease states. The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and efficacy of therapies, both currently marketed and under clinical development, may be directly impacted by the physiological alterations that occur secondary to the occurrence of chronic excess body weight. The increased prevalence of this disease should not be ignored. Both private and federal institutions involved in drug research and development should consider, as appropriate, a greater inclusion of individuals who are obese in clinical trials throughout the entirety of drug development, and leverage the available PK, PD, safety, and efficacy data to make more informed dosing recommendations.",D006801:Humans;D009765:Obesity;D000076722:Drug Development;D054796:Drug Dosage Calculations;D010599:Pharmacokinetics,diabetes
Model-Informed Approaches to Support Drug Development for Patients With Obesity: A Regulatory Perspective.,"Obesity, which is defined as having a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater, has been recognized as a serious health problem that increases the risk of many comorbidities (eg, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes) and mortality. The high prevalence of individuals who are classified as obese calls for additional considerations in clinical trial design. Nevertheless, gaining a comprehensive understanding of how obesity affects the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of drugs proves challenging, primarily as obese patients are seldom selected for enrollment at the early stages of drug development. Over the past decade, model-informed drug development (MIDD) approaches have been increasingly used in drug development programs for obesity and its related diseases as they use and integrate all available sources and knowledge to inform and facilitate clinical drug development. This review summarizes the impact of obesity on PK, PD, and the efficacy of drugs and, more importantly, provides an overview of the use of MIDD approaches in drug development and regulatory decision making for patients with obesity: estimating PK, PD, and efficacy in specific dosing scenarios, optimizing dose regimen, and providing evidence for seeking new indication(s). Recent review cases using MIDD approaches to support dose selection and provide confirmatory evidence for effectiveness for patients with obesity, including pediatric patients, are discussed. These examples demonstrate the promise of MIDD as a valuable tool in supporting clinical trial design during drug development and facilitating regulatory decision-making processes for the benefit of patients with obesity.",D006801:Humans;D002648:Child;D000076722:Drug Development;D009765:Obesity;D015992:Body Mass Index;D002985:Clinical Protocols,diabetes
Neuro-HIV-New insights into pathogenesis and emerging therapeutic targets.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is a term describing a complex set of cognitive impairments accompanying HIV infection. Successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the most severe forms of HAND, but milder forms affect over 50% of people living with HIV (PLWH). Pathogenesis of HAND in the ART era remains unknown. A variety of pathogenic factors, such as persistent HIV replication in the brain reservoir, HIV proteins released from infected brain cells, HIV-induced neuroinflammation, and some components of ART, have been implicated in driving HAND pathogenesis in ART-treated individuals. Here, we propose another factor-impairment of cholesterol homeostasis and lipid rafts by HIV-1 protein Nef-as a possible contributor to HAND pathogenesis. These effects of Nef on cholesterol may also underlie the effects of other pathogenic factors that constitute the multifactorial nature of HAND pathogenesis. The proposed Nef- and cholesterol-focused mechanism may provide a long-sought unified explanation of HAND pathogenesis that takes into account all contributing factors. Evidence for the impairment by Nef of cellular cholesterol balance, potential effects of this impairment on brain cells, and opportunities to therapeutically target this element of HAND pathogenesis are discussed.","D006801:Humans;D015658:HIV Infections;D015497:HIV-1;D001921:Brain;D002784:Cholesterol;D054311:nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus",diabetes
"Diethyl phthalate, a plasticizer, induces adipocyte inflammation and apoptosis in mice after long-term dietary administration.","The incidence of metabolic diseases is increasing alarmingly in recent times. Parallel to nutritional excess and sedentary lifestyle, the random usage of several endocrine disrupting chemicals including plasticizers is reported to be closely associated with metabolic diseases. Diethyl phthalate (DEP) is a widely used plasticizer in a host of consumer and daily care products. Adipose tissue plays a central role in energy storage and whole-body metabolism. The impairment of adipose function is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, diabetes, and related metabolic diseases. Recently, exposure to certain phthalate esters has been linked to the development of obesity and diabetes, although there are contradictions and the mechanisms are not clearly understood. In an effort to ascertain the metabolic consequences of chronic phthalate exposure and the underlying mechanism, the present study was designed to examine the effects of long-term dietary consumption of DEP in adipocytes. DEP-treated mice were hyperglycemic but nonobese; their body weight initially increased which subsequently was reduced compared to control. DEP exposure at lower levels impaired adipogenesis by downregulating the key transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and its downstream insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin, thereby severely compromising adipocyte function. The activation of master regulator nuclear factor κB led to rise in proinflammatory cytokines. We found that DEP triggered intrinsic apoptotic pathways through activated cytochrome c-Apaf1-caspase 9-caspase 3 axis in adipocytes. Taken together, our data revealed that chronic administration of dietary DEP could unleash adverse metabolic outcomes by initiating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the adipocytes, thus leading to adipose tissue dysfunction.",adipocyte;apoptosis;diethyl phthalate;inflammation;mice;oxidative stress,diabetes
Impact of proteinuria on long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease.,"This study aimed to investigate the association between proteinuria and long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease. This was a single-center observational study. A total of 1351 patients were identified who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and whose urine data were available. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (n = 245) or absence (n = 1106) of proteinuria. All-cause and cardiovascular deaths were primarily evaluated. The prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes were significantly higher, and the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower in patients with proteinuria than in those without proteinuria. During the median follow-up of 4.1 years (interquartile range, 1.7-6.8 years), the occurrences of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths were significantly higher in patients with proteinuria. Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that the presence of proteinuria was a significant predictor of cardiovascular death as well as age, BMI, reduced eGFR, and left ventricular ejection fraction. When stratified into four groups based on eGFR category (eGFR <60 or ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and absence or presence of proteinuria, the incidence rates of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths were highest in patients with proteinuria and eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Furthermore, the incidence rates of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths were significantly higher in patients with proteinuria among both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Proteinuria is associated with the long-term prognosis, and all-cause and cardiovascular deaths in patients with coronary artery disease, regardless of eGFR and the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus.","D006801:Humans;D003324:Coronary Artery Disease;D002318:Cardiovascular Diseases;D013318:Stroke Volume;D016277:Ventricular Function, Left;D011507:Proteinuria;D011379:Prognosis;D005919:Glomerular Filtration Rate;D012307:Risk Factors",diabetes
Effect of exercise intervention on clinical parameters in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The effect of exercise on clinical parameters in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unknown. In this meta-analysis, we identified and evaluated the effect of exercise on clinical parameters (BMI, ALT, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism) in patients with NAFLD combined with T2DM. We conducted a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CNKI in December 2022. Data from relevant randomized controlled trials were collected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. 6 eligible studies with 238 subjects were finally included. We used Review Manager 5.3 for meta-analysis. The study found that exercise improved BMI, ALT, TC, LDL-C, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR, TG, but did not significantly improve HDL-C. Subgroup analysis showed that high-intensity interval training significantly improved BMI (SMD: -0.43, 95% CI: -0.80, -0.06), ALT (SMD: -4.63, 95% CI: -8.42, -0.83), TC (SMD: -0.94, 95% CI: -1.82, -0.07), LDL-C (SMD: -0. 87, 95% CI: -1.26, -0.49), HbA1c (SMD: -1.12, 95% CI: -1.75, -0.48), HOMA-IR (SMD: -0.59, 95% CI: -0.94, -0.25); moderate-intensity continuous training improved ALT (SMD: -3.96, 95% CI: -7.71, -0.21), TG (SMD: -1.59, 95% CI: -2.58, -0.61), HbA1c (SMD: -0.71, 95% CI: -1.37, -0.05), HOMA-IR (SMD: -1.73, 95% CI: -3.40, -0. 06), and to some extent HDL-C levels (SMD: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.04, 1.02); resistance training improved LDL-C (SMD: -2.06, 95% CI: -3.14, -0.98).

Diabetic wound healing of aloe vera major phytoconstituents through TGF-β1 suppression ,"To restore the integrity of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the wound healing process involves a complex series of well-orchestrated biochemical and cellular events. Due to the existence of various active components, accessibility and few side effects, some plant extracts and their phytoconstituents are recognised as viable options for wound healing agents. To find possible inhibitors of diabetic wound healing, four main constituents of aloe vera were identified from the literature. TGF-β1 and the compounds were studied using molecular docking to see how they interacted with the active site of target protein (PDB ID: 6B8Y). The pharmacokinetics investigation of the aloe emodin with the highest dock score complied with all the Lipinski's rule of five and pharmacokinetics criteria. Conformational change in the docked complex of Aloe emodin was investigated with the Amber simulation software, via a molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. The MD simulations of aloe emodin bound to TGF-β1 showed the significant structural rotations and twists occurring from 0 to 200 ns. The estimate of the aloe emodin-TGF-β1 complex's binding free energy has also been done using MM-PBSA/GBSA techniques. Additionally, aloe emodin has a wide range of enzymatic activities since their probability active (Pa) values is >0.700. 'Aloe emodin', an active extract of aloe vera, has been identified as the key chemical in the current investigation that can inhibit diabetic wound healing. Both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments will be used in a wet lab to confirm the current computational findings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Chitosan-sodium percarbonate-based hydrogels with sustained oxygen release potential stimulated angiogenesis and accelerated wound healing.,"The prolonged hypoxic conditions hinder chronic wounds from healing and lead to severe conditions such as delayed re-epithelialization and enhanced risk of infection. Multifunctional wound dressings are highly required to address the challenges of chronic wounds. Herein, we report polyurethane-coated sodium per carbonate-loaded chitosan hydrogel (CSPUO2 ) as a multifunctional dressing. The hydrogels (Control, CSPU, and CSPUO2 ) were prepared by freeze gelation method and the developed hydrogels showed high porosity, good absorption capacity, and adequate biodegradability. The release of oxygen from the CSPUO2 hydrogel was confirmed by the increase in pH and a sustained oxygen release was observed over the period of 21 days, due to polyurethane (CSPU) coating. The CSPUO2 hydrogel exhibited around 2-fold increased angiogenic potential in CAM assay when compared with Control and CSPU dressing. CSPUO2 also showed good level of antibacterial efficacy against E. coli and S. aureus. In a full-thickness rat wound model, CSPUO2 hydrogel considerably accelerated wound healing with exceptional re-epithelialization granulation tissue formation less inflammatory cells and improved skin architecture highlighting the tremendous therapeutic potential of this hydrogel when compared with control and CSPU to treat chronic diabetic and burn wounds.",angiogenesis;hypoxia;oxygen releasing hydrogel;sodium percarbonate (SPC);wound healing,diabetes

We also assessed the epidemiological trend of diabetes from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, 110.1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 101.2-119.4) people aged ≥70 years were living with diabetes (types 1 and 2 combined) with a global prevalence of 23.7% (21.8%-25.8%). Worldwide, 181.9 deaths (163.0-194.7) per 100,000 population and 4512.3 DALYs (3861.3-5264.2) per 100,000 population occurred due to diabetes. In 2019, minor sex-related disparities in the burden of diabetes were identified among specific age and sex groups. From 1990 to 2019, the prevalence of diabetes increased by 39.7% (37.7%-41.7%), and the related mortality and DALY rates also increased (16.4% [9.43%-22.9%] and 22.3% [17.2%-27.0%], respectively). The global burden of diabetes in adults aged ≥70 has increased markedly from 1990 to 2019. As the population continues to age, there is an urgent need to combat the increasing disease burden.",aged (70+);diabetes;disability-adjusted life-year;mortality;prevalence,diabetes
Recurrent Cryptogenic Strokes in a Young female as a novel presentation of Parry Romberg Syndrome: A Case Report and Review.,"Parry Romberg Syndrome (PRS) is a less common genetic condition presenting with progressive hemifacial atrophy involving skin, underlying connective tissue, muscle and facial bone. Neurological manifestations include seizures, headaches, deafness and trigeminal neuralgia refractory to medications, while stroke is a less common presentation. A 43-year-old right-handed female with previous history of Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) type facial palsy, seizure disorder and linear scleroderma, presented to our clinic with recurrent cryptogenic strokes. She developed progressive hemifacial atrophy on the left side and left eye ectropion and was eventually diagnosed with rare Parry Romberg Syndrome. Patient underwent extensive work up for stroke to rule out etiologies like hyperlipidemia, diabetes, lupus and vasculitis. Peripheral labs for inflammatory markers and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were unremarkable. Brain imaging at different points in time showed progressive atrophy of brain parenchyma, overlying bone, connective tissue and facial muscles on the left side. Central Nervous System (CNS) vessel imaging and diagnostic cerebral angiogram was unremarkable. This novel case underscores the potential CNS involvement in PRS, which is a rare disease entity. Neurological manifestations are not uncommon, including stroke. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of stroke in this rare disease process, that could help develop potential therapeutic targets.",Cryptogenic strokes;Hemifacial atrophy;Parry Romberg Syndrome,diabetes
Results From a Virtual Clinic for the Follow-up of Patients Using the Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop System.,"Evidence regarding the implementation of medium-term strategies in advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) system users is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of the AHCL system in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on a six-month follow-up in a virtual diabetes clinic (VDC). A prospective cohort of adult patients with T1D treated using the AHCL system (Mini Med 780G; Medtronic, Northridge, California) in a VDC follow-up. Standardized training and follow-up were conducted virtually. Clinical data and metabolic control outcomes were reported at baseline, and at three and six months. Sixty-four patients (mean age = 42 ± 14.6 years, 65% men, 54% with graduate education) were included. Percentage time in range (%TIR) increased significantly regardless of prior therapy with intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring + multiple daily injections and sensor-augmented pump therapy with predictive low-glucose management after starting AHCL and persisted during the follow-up period with no hypoglycemic events. The %TIR 70 to 180 mg/dL according to socioeconomic strata was 73.4% ± 5.3%, 78.1% ± 8.1%, and 84.2% ± 7.5% for the lower, middle, and upper strata, respectively. The sensor was used more frequently in the population with a higher education level. Adherence to sensor use and SmartGuard retention were higher in patients who underwent the VDC follow-up. Medium-term follow-up of users of AHCL systems in a VDC contributes to safely achieving %TIR goals. Virtual diabetes clinic follow-up favored adherence to sensor use and continuous SmartGuard use. Socioeconomic strata were associated with a better glycemic profile and education level was associated with better adherence to sensor use.",advanced hybrid closed-loop;telemedicine;time in range;type 1 diabetes,diabetes

[Assessment of environmental and genetic risk factors for the development of primary open-angle glaucoma].,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a multifactorial disease with both environmental and genetic factors involved in its pathogenesis. The study evaluates the role of a number of environmental and genetic risk factors in the risk of POAG development and builds a prognostic model. The study group included 197 patients aged 44 to 90 years (98 - patients with POAG, 99 - the control group), who were treated in the Republican Clinical Ophthalmological Hospital of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan named after Prof. E.V. Adamyuk. Age, family history of the disease, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension were revealed to be associated with an increased risk of POAG development. The polymorphisms of matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes were shown to influence the development of POAG. The prognostic model considering these factors had high sensitivity and specificity (72.0% and 82.6% respectively). The prognostic model based on environmental and genetic factors is important for assessing the risk of POAG and early detection of the disease.","D006801:Humans;D005902:Glaucoma, Open-Angle;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D016022:Case-Control Studies;D011110:Polymorphism, Genetic;D012307:Risk Factors",diabetes
Risk of hyperkalemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus prescribed with SGLT2 versus DPP-4 inhibitors.,"To investigate the risk of hyperkalemia in new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients with T2DM who commenced treatment with an SGLT2 or DPP-4 inhibitor between 2015 and 2019 were collected. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was applied to compare the risk of central laboratory-determined severe hyperkalemia, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, ≥5.5 mmol/L, and < 3.5 mmol/L, respectively), and initiation of a potassium binder in patients newly prescribed an SGLT2 or DPP-4 inhibitor. 28 599 patients (mean age 60 ± 11 years, 60.9% male) were included after 1:2 propensity score matching, of whom 10 586 were new users of SGLT2 inhibitors and 18 013 DPP-4 inhibitors. During a 2-year follow-up, severe hyperkalemia developed in 122 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 325 DPP-4 inhibitor users. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a 29% reduction in incident severe hyperkalemia (HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.58-0.88) compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. Risk of hyperkalemia (HR 0.81, 95%CI 0.71-0.92) and prescription of a potassium binder (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.67-0.82) were likewise decreased with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. Occurrence of incident hypokalemia was nonetheless similar between those prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor (HR 0.90, 95%CI 0.81-1.01). Our study provides real-world evidence that compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with lower risk of hyperkalemia, and did not increase the incidence of hypokalemia in patients with T2DM.",DPP-4 inhibitors;Hyperkalemia;SGLT2 inhibitors;Type 2 diabetes mellitus,diabetes
Gut microbiota regulates postprandial GLP-1 response via ileal bile acid-TGR5 signaling.,"The gut microbiota interacts with intestinal epithelial cells through microbial metabolites to regulate the release of gut hormones. We investigated whether the gut microbiota affects the postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response using antibiotic-treated mice and germ-free mice. Gut microbiome depletion completely abolished postprandial GLP-1 response in the circulation and ileum in a lipid tolerance test. Microbiome depletion did not influence the GLP-1 secretory function of primary ileal cells in response to stimulators in vitro, but dramatically changed the postprandial dynamics of endogenous bile acids, particularly ω-muricholic acid (ωMCA) and hyocholic acid (HCA). The bile acid receptor Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) but not farnesoid X receptor (FXR), participated in the regulation of postprandial GLP-1 response in the circulation and ileum, and ωMCA or HCA stimulated GLP-1 secretion via TGR5. Finally, fecal microbiota transplantation or ωMCA and HCA supplementation restored postprandial GLP-1 response. In conclusion, gut microbiota is indispensable for maintaining the postprandial GLP-1 response specifically in the ileum, and bile acid (ωMCA and HCA)-TGR5 signaling is involved in this process. This study helps to understand the essential interplay between the gut microbiota and host in regulating postprandial GLP-1 response and opens the foundation for new therapeutic targets.","D051379:Mice;D000818:Animals;D052216:Glucagon-Like Peptide 1;D000069196:Gastrointestinal Microbiome;D015398:Signal Transduction;D043562:Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled;D001647:Bile Acids and Salts;D007082:Ileum",diabetes
Current and future therapies to treat impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.,"In order to achieve optimal glycemic control, intensive insulin regimes are needed for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and insulin-dependent Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Unfortunately, intensive glycemic control often results in insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Moreover, recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia result in both the loss of the characteristic warning symptoms associated with hypoglycemia and an attenuated counterregulatory hormone responses. The blunting of warning symptoms is known as impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH). Together, IAH and the loss of the hormonal response is termed hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure (HAAF). IAH is prevalent in up to 25% in people with T1D and up to 10% in people with T2D. IAH and HAAF increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia 6-fold and 25-fold, respectively. To reduce this risk for severe hypoglycemia, multiple different therapeutic approaches are being explored that could improve awareness of hypoglycemia. Current therapies to improve awareness of hypoglycemia include patient education and psychoeducation, the use of novel glycemic control technology, pancreas/islet transplantation, and drug therapy. This review examines both existing therapies and potential therapies that are in pre-clinical testing. Novel treatments that improve awareness of hypoglycemia, via improving the counterregulatory hormone responses or improving hypoglycemic symptom recognition, would also shed light on the possible neurological mechanisms that lead to the development of IAH. To reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes, elucidating the mechanism behind IAH, as well as developing targeted therapies is currently an unmet need for those that suffer from IAH.",counterregulation;diabetes;hypoglycemia;impaired awareness;insulin;unawareness,diabetes
"A Prospective Study of Stroke Characteristics, Risk Factors, and Mortality in a Tertiary Hospital of Northern Ethiopia.","As developing countries experience the epidemiologic transition to chronic diseases, morbidity and mortality from stroke is expected to rise. Stroke and other non-communicable diseases are increasing in Ethiopia but prospective data are scarce and there are not enough data regarding the characteristics, risk factors and mortality of stroke. Aimed at determining the risk factors, clinical profiles and treatment outcomes of stroke admissions in Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Tigray, Ethiopia. This is a prospective cross-sectional study of all adult stroke patients admitted over consecutive 12 months period in medical ward and ICU of Ayder Comprehensive sSpecialized Hospital, northern Ethiopia. Medical residents through a pre-designed questionnaire collected data. Monovariate analysis, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis to control for confounder variables were done using software SPSS version 26. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There were 272 stroke admissions to medical ward and ICU over the 1-year period. Stroke comprised 13.05% of total medical admissions. Ischemic stroke accounted for 62.9% of stroke admissions. Stroke in the young accounted for 14.7% of all stroke admissions. Hypertension was the most common risk factor identified, found in 51.8%. Diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation were the other common risk factors. The in-hospital mortality was 13.6%. The only independent predictor of mortality identified was presence of complications, AOR [95% CI] of 2.4 [1.4, 5.3], P-value of 0.028. Aspiration pneumonia was the most common complication. This study showed a high burden of stroke among medical admissions in northern Ethiopia. Being the most common risk factor for stroke, the high burden of undiagnosed and untreated hypertension needs special attention and efforts on community awareness should be enhanced. The relatively higher mortality illustrates the need to establish stroke centers to enhance the quality of stroke care.",hemorrhagic stroke;ischemic stroke;mortality;northern Ethiopia;risk factors,diabetes
A pilot retrospective study of a physician-directed and genomics-based model for precision lifestyle medicine.,"Precision lifestyle medicine is a relatively new field in primary care, based on the hypothesis that genetic predispositions influence an individual's response to specific interventions such as diet, exercise, and prescription medications. Despite the increase in commercially available genomic testing, few studies have investigated effects of a physician-directed program to optimize chronic disease using genomics-based precision medicine. We performed an pilot, observational cohort study to evaluate effects of the Wild Health program, a physician and health coach service offering genomics-based lifestyle and medical interventions, on biomarkers indicative of chronic disease. 871 patients underwent genomic testing, biomarker testing, and ongoing health coaching after initial medical consultation by a physician. Improvements in several clinically relevant out-of-range biomarkers at baseline were identified in a large proportion of patients treated through lifestyle intervention without the use of prescription medication. Notably, normalization of several biomarkers associated with chronic disease occurred in 47.5% (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), 33.3% (low density lipoprotein particle number [LDL-P]), and 33.2% (C-reactive protein [CRP]). However, due to the inherent limitations of our observational study design and use of retrospective data, ongoing work will be crucial for continuing to shed light on the effectiveness of physician-led, genomics-based lifestyle coaching programs. Future studies would benefit from implementing a randomized controlled study design, tracking specific interventions, and evaluating physiological data, such as BMI.",cardiovascular disease;chronic disease;diabetes;genomics;health coaching;precision medicine;primary care,diabetes
Effect of Air Pollution Particulate Matter on Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke: A Scoping Review.,"Air pollution particulate matter (PM) exposure has been established as a risk factor for stroke. However, few studies have investigated the effects of PM exposure on stroke subtypes (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke). Ischemic (IS) and hemorrhagic strokes (HS) involve distinctive pathophysiological pathways and may be differentially influenced by PM exposure. This review aims to characterize the effects of PM exposure on ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It also identifies subpopulations that may be uniquely vulnerable to PM toxicity. Pubmed was queried from 2000 to 2023 to identify clinical and epidemiological studies examining the association between PM exposure and stroke subtypes (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke). Inclusion criteria were: 1) articles written in English 2) clinical and epidemiological studies 3) studies with a clear definition of stroke, IS, HS, and air pollution 4) studies reporting the effects of PM and 5) studies that included distinct analyses per stroke subtype. Two independent reviewers screened the literature for applicable studies. A total of 50 articles were included in this review. Overall, PM exposure increases ischemic stroke risk in both lightly and heavily polluted countries. The association between PM exposure and hemorrhagic stroke is variable and may be influenced by a country's ambient air pollution levels. A stronger association between PM exposure and stroke is demonstrated in older individuals and those with pre-existing diabetes. There is no clear effect of sex or hypertension on PM-associated stroke risk. Current literature suggests PM exposure increases ischemic stroke risk, with an unclear effect on hemorrhagic stroke risk. Older patients and those with pre-existing diabetes may be the most vulnerable to PM toxicity. Future investigations are needed to characterize the influence of sex and hypertension on PM-associated stroke risk.",air pollution;hemorrhagic stroke;ischemic stroke;particulate matter;stroke,diabetes
"Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Among People With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Urban Slums of Central Karnataka, India.","The intricate interplay between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) necessitates a comprehensive investigation into the cardiovascular risk landscape among individuals with T2DM. The burgeoning global burden of both conditions underscores the urgency of targeted research in this area, with the potential to inform preventive strategies and mitigate adverse cardiovascular outcomes. By unravelling the risk of CVD among T2DM patients and identifying key risk factors, the current research could pave the way for tailored interventions that could have the potential to substantially alleviate the cardiovascular burden associated with T2DM. To assess the cardiovascular risk and its determinants among T2DM patients. A cross sectional study was conducted among known diabetes patients accessing urban outreach clinic serving approximately 20,000 population across 18 urban slums in central Karnataka from September 2022 to June 2023. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on socio-demographic details and CVD risk was assessed using QRISK3 score. Data were entered in Excel 2019 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and analysed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and are presented in the tables and figures. A total of 483 adults above 30 years participated in the study. Among them, the majority were men (67.9%). Cardiovascular risk factors were found more among males and the 10-year cardiovascular risk assessment prediction through QRISK3 score was higher among males compared to females and it was found to be statistically significant (13.5±8.6% vs. 19.5±10.1%, p<0.001). According to a comparison of cardiovascular risk variables by gender among diabetic patients using the QRISK3's 10-year risk assessment, males, smokers/tobacco users, obese, and known hypertensives had significantly greater risk.",cardiovascular risk;qrisk3;risk assessment;type 2 diabetes mellitus;urban slums,diabetes
Association of Early Pregnancy Values of Glycosylated Hemoglobin and the Development of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Introduction There is no consensus regarding screening and diagnostic methods for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The present study aimed to evaluate the association between early pregnancy values of glycosylated hemoglobin and the development of gestational diabetes mellitus among pregnant women in a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. Methods The prospective cohort study included 200 pregnant women aged between 18 and 35 years in their first trimester (gestational age eight to 13 weeks) attending the antenatal clinics of the study hospital. A glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) test were done in all study participants in their first trimester. Pregnant women with HbA1c ≥6.5% and OGTT ≥140 mg/dl were excluded from the study. In other women, the second trimester (24-28 weeks) and the third trimester OGTT (32-34 weeks) were done to detect gestational diabetes mellitus. Data collection was initiated after the approval of the Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) and relevant authorities. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was done to identify the cut-off value of HbA1c that predicted the development of GDM. Results The incidence of GDM was 33% among our study participants. The mean HbA1c was significantly higher among women who had GDM (5.4 ± 0.4%) as compared to those who did not develop GDM (4.9 ± 0.2%) (p<0.001). On ROC analysis of HbA1c values to predict the development of GDM, a cut-off value of HbA1c ≥5.25%, irrespective of risk status, was calculated to have 84.8% sensitivity and 62.7% specificity, and among the high-risk group, HbA1c ≥5.15% had 83.3% sensitivity and 97% specificity in predicting GDM. On stratified analysis, a moderately strong positive correlation was demonstrated between HbA1c values and OGTT in the second trimester in both high-risk and low-risk cohorts (p<0.05). Conclusion Based on the findings of the present study, HbA1c can be proposed to be a suitable biomarker for GDM prediction, probably not independently but rather as a component of a multi-marker approach for high- and low-risk pregnant groups.",gdm;gestational diabetes mellitus;hba1c;high-risk pregnancy;ogtt;oral glucose tolerance test;pregnancy complications,diabetes
Effects of Single-Course Betamethasone on the Outcomes of Late Preterm Neonates.,"Background Prenatal glucocorticoids are commonly used in pregnancies before 34 weeks of gestation in women at risk of preterm delivery; however, the effects of these drugs on late preterm infants (those born after the 34th week of pregnancy) are controversial. As a result, we aimed to investigate the effect of a single course of betamethasone (two doses of betamethasone every 24 hours) on the neonatal outcome of late preterm births. Methods We retrospectively assessed all spontaneous late preterm births (34-36+6 weeks of gestation) at a tertiary hospital in Iran over a period of two and a half years. Exclusion criteria included multiple pregnancies, induced labor, and fetal malformations identified in sonograms. Neonatal outcome measures encompassed first and five-minute Apgar scores, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal death, birth asphyxia, and the need for positive pressure ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, tracheal intubation, and surfactant. Baseline characteristics, such as maternal age, parity, fetal gender, and high-risk pregnancy, were considered confounding variables. High-risk pregnancies were defined as any cases involving prolonged rupture of membranes or maternal comorbidities such as severe anemia, preeclampsia, diabetes, or COVID-19. Results During the study period, there were 830 spontaneous preterm births at our center. Of these, only 195 (23.5%) received complete doses of betamethasone. Low birth weight was more common in mothers who did not receive betamethasone compared to those who did (63.6% vs. 41.2%). The mean gestational age was lower in mothers who received betamethasone than in those who did not. Respiratory distress syndrome was more common in mothers who received betamethasone (P<0.001, RR 2.11, 95% CI (0.98-4.18)). However, after adjusting for confounding factors, such as gestational age and birth weight, betamethasone did not increase the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. Other adverse neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly. Conclusions There were no differences in neonatal outcomes between those who received betamethasone and those who did not.",betamethasone;corticosteroid;glucocorticosteroid;neonatal outcome;preterm birth,diabetes
"Emergency Department Frequentation and Unscheduled Visits of Liver Transplant Patients: Ten Years Experience in Tertiary Care Center, Saudi Arabia.","Introduction and objectives Liver transplantation and its indications represent an increased burden on patients' health. This can be represented in a variety of ways, such as in emergency visits, unscheduled clinic visits, and unanticipated admissions. This study aims to analyze emergency department (ED) visits, the most common presenting complaints, and the outcomes of those visits. Methods A retrospective observational study was performed in which electronic medical records were reviewed for all patients who underwent liver transplantation and presented to the emergency department between October 2011 and October 2021. The following data were collected: demographics, comorbidities, liver transplant features, and emergency department visit data and outcomes. Recurrent visits were assessed and labeled as first, second, third, fourth, and fifth or more. Results A total of 699 patients and 5,225 visits were included in the analysis. Living donors accounted for 80% of all transplants. The mean post-operative length of stay was 22.6 ± 17.8. The majority of patients (74%) had at least one comorbidity, with diabetes (47%), hypertension (31%), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (16%) being the commonest comorbidities; however, comorbidities were not associated with an increased risk of emergency department visits. Out of the 5,225 visits to the emergency department, 2,265 (41%) were within the first year. Emergency department visits in the first seven days after discharge amounted to 22% of total first visits. By 30 days, six months, and one year, they increased to 46%, 83%, and 91%, respectively. Living donor recipients had an average of 7.3 ED visits as compared to deceased donor recipients, who had an average of 8.4 ED visits. The most common presenting complaints were gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (18%), infectious disease symptoms (9%), and respiratory symptoms (8%). There were a total of 296 patients who were readmitted at least once since discharge after liver transplantation. Conclusion The majority of first-time presentations to ED occurred in the first year post-transplant, marking this time period as critical for liver transplant patients. Our study also highlighted the continual presentations of liver transplant patients to the ED a few years post-transplant. This requires close scrutiny of the main causes of such presentations as well as comparison with other transplant cases to identify whether they are specific to liver transplants or not.",emergency department frequentation;emergency department visit rates;liver transplantation;living donor liver transplant-ldlt;transplant recipient,diabetes
Severity of Adverse Effects of Sinovac COVID-19 Vaccine in Postmenopausal Women: A Multicenter Experience From Pakistan.,"Introduction The most significant element in halting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic was the availability of reliable and efficient vaccines. Vaccine acceptability is influenced by many factors, including perceptions of the vaccine's safety and side effects. Adverse reactions to vaccines can vary with regard to the type, although they are frequently mild, localized, temporary, and self-limiting. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of side effects experienced by postmenopausal women after receiving the Sinovac vaccine. Methods This multicenter, prospective cross-sectional study was carried out at multiple centers in Karachi, Pakistan. In this study, the non-probability sampling method was used. The study continued from August 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023, for six months. The study comprised 600 postmenopausal women over the age of 50 years who received two doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccination. Demographic parameters such as gender, the existence of comorbidities, and local and systemic side effects in postmenopausal women were documented as frequencies and percentages. Age, weight, and duration of comorbidities are expressed as means and standard deviations. Results The study findings showed that the mean age of study participants was 63.93 ± 8.24 years. There were related comorbidities with hypertension and diabetes mellitus in 181 (30.2%) and 40 (6.7%) women, respectively. Fever was the most often reported side effect, with 349 (58.2%) participants reporting it and 198 (56.7%) participants reporting it as mild. After the second dose, 234 (39.5%) participants reported fever as their most frequent adverse effect, and 158 (67.5%) of them reported it was mild. Conclusion This study concluded that the most commonly reported side effects among postmenopausal women were fever, pain, and swelling at the injection site after getting either dose of Sinovac vaccine. These overall side effects were generally mild to moderate in intensity, not life-threatening, and did not require hospitalization, although fever was reported in severe intensity in some cases, particularly after the first dose.",covid-19;fever;pain;post-menopausal women;sinovac;swelling;vaccine,diabetes
Daptomycin-Induced Acute Liver Failure: A Rare Case Report.,"Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by severe liver injury, encephalopathy, and impaired coagulation/synthetic function. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can rarely, in a dose-dependent manner, lead to ALF. This article presents a rare case of daptomycin-induced acute liver failure in a patient with no prior liver disease. A 73-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease received daptomycin treatment for diabetic left foot osteomyelitis. Five days after starting therapy, he developed weakness, jaundice, and drowsiness, leading to ICU admission. Physical examination and labs revealed hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes and abnormal ultrasound findings. Autoimmune and infectious causes were ruled out. Daptomycin was discontinued, and the patient's labs showed significant improvement within three days. One week after recovery from acute liver failure, he experienced cardiogenic shock due to worsening of his underlying heart failure and was transferred to the Cardiac ICU before ultimately being discharged to inpatient hospice care. To our best knowledge, this is the first reported case of daptomycin-induced acute liver failure, presenting with massive liver enzyme elevations, synthetic dysfunction, and encephalopathy. The Naranjo scale score suggests a probable causal relationship between daptomycin and liver injury. While a few cases of daptomycin-induced liver injury have been reported, there are no previous reports of acute liver failure. The rapid development of liver failure following daptomycin administration and subsequent recovery after discontinuation is noteworthy. However, various confounding factors and the mechanism of daptomycin-induced liver failure remain unclear. Further research is needed to identify predisposing factors and better understand this rare complication. While rare, this care also raises caution to follow liver function closely while prescribing daptomycin.",acute liver failure;acute liver injury;antibiotic side effects;daptomycin;drug induced liver failure,diabetes
Effect of Neck-Deep Immersion in Cool or Thermoneutral Water on Blood Glucose Levels in Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes.,"It is unclear whether immersion in cool water, typical of many beaches, increases the concentration of blood glucose in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). To test the hypothesis in individuals with T1DM that immersion neck-deep in cool water (COOL) causes an increase in blood glucose concentration, but not exposure to thermoneutral water (THERMO) or thermoneutral air. Eight overnight-fasted participants with T1DM were exposed for 60 minutes on separate days to 3 experimental conditions: cool water (COOL, 23 °C); thermoneutral water (THERMO, 33.5 °C); or thermoneutral air (24 °C). They then recovered for 60 minutes on land at 24 °C. At time intervals, we measured: blood glucose and plasma insulin concentration, rate of carbohydrate and fat oxidation, skin and core temperature, subcutaneous blood flow, and shivering via electromyography. There was no change in blood glucose concentration during the 3 experimental conditions (P > .05). During recovery after COOL, blood glucose increased (P < .05) but did not change in the other 2 conditions. The rate of carbohydrate oxidation during and early after COOL was higher than in the other 2 conditions (P < .05), and COOL led to a decrease in subcutaneous blood flow and the concentration of plasma insulin (P < .05). Cool or thermoneutral neck-deep immersion in water does not cause a change in the concentration of blood glucose in people with T1DM, but on-land recovery from COOL causes an increase in blood glucose that may be due, at least in part, to the accompanying decrease in plasma insulin.",blood glucose;cool water immersion;hypoglycemia;thermoneutral water immersion;type 1 diabetes mellitus;water immersion,diabetes
Multivariable Model to Predict an ACTH Stimulation Test to Diagnose Adrenal Insufficiency Using Previous Test Results.,"The adrenocorticotropin hormone stimulation test (AST) is used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency, and is often repeated in patients when monitoring recovery of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. To develop and validate a prediction model that uses previous AST results with new baseline cortisol to predict the result of a new AST. This was a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study in patients who had undergone at least 2 ASTs, using polynomial regression with backwards variable selection, at a Tertiary UK adult endocrinology center. Model was developed from 258 paired ASTs over 5 years in 175 adults (mean age 52.4 years, SD 16.4), then validated on data from 111 patients over 1 year (51.8, 17.5) from the same center, data collected after model development. Candidate prediction variables included previous test baseline adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), previous test baseline and 30-minute cortisol, days between tests, and new baseline ACTH and cortisol used with calculated cortisol/ACTH ratios to assess 8 candidate predictors. The main outcome measure was a new test cortisol measured 30 minutes after Synacthen administration. Using 258 sequential ASTs from 175 patients for model development and 111 patient tests for model validation, previous baseline cortisol, previous 30-minute cortisol and new baseline cortisol were superior at predicting new 30-minute cortisol (R2 = 0.71 [0.49-0.93], area under the curve [AUC] = 0.97 [0.94-1.0]) than new baseline cortisol alone (R2 = 0.53 [0.22-0.84], AUC = 0.88 [0.81-0.95]). Results of a previous AST can be objectively combined with new early-morning cortisol to predict the results of a new AST better than new early-morning cortisol alone.

A Case of Dellen Formation following 27-Gauge Vitrectomy with Rapid Improvement by Scleral and Conjunctival Sutures.,"Dellen is a corneal disease characterized by shallow, saucer-like excavations at the corneal margin. Herein, we presented a case of dellen formation that developed following a 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and was rapidly resolved using scleral and conjunctival sutures. A 73-year-old woman underwent a 27-gauge PPV for the epiretinal membrane of the right eye. Intraoperatively, owing to coexisting diabetic retinopathy, the peripheral vitreous was shaved, and retinal photocoagulation was performed on the peripheral retina. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mm Hg on 1 day after the PPV and on postoperative day 4; however, on day 14, the IOP decreased to 10 mm Hg, and conjunctival bleb formation was observed. By day 18, the bleb height remained unchanged, and dellen formation was noted at the corneal periphery. Because of marked corneal thinning, conjunctival and scleral sutures were placed 20 days following the PPV. Intraoperative findings revealed leakage from the scleral wound at the trocar puncture site. The IOP increased to 20 mm Hg at 19 h following the suture, resulting in the disappearance of the bleb and dellen. Since then, the bleb or dellen did not recur. We encountered a case of late-onset scleral wound cleavage 2 weeks following microincision vitreous surgery, resulting in bleb and dellen formation, which was immediately managed by the scleral and conjunctiva suturing.",Bleb;Dellen;Vitrectomy,diabetes
"Outcome of Diabetic Keto Acidosis Treatment and Associated Factors Among Adult Patients Admitted to Emergency and Medical Wards at St. Paul's Hospital, Addis Ababa Ethiopia, 2023: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially fatal disease that affects adults. Therefore, rapid detection and treatment are required to decrease mortality rates. Most of the earlier research on diabetic ketoacidosis in Ethiopia concentrated on its prevalence and associated factors. This study aimed to assess the treatment outcomes of diabetic ketoacidosis and its associated factors in adult patients admitted to St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 2023. This institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample size of 357. The data were entered in Epidata version 4.6 and exported to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 for analysis. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was estimated to determine its association with outcome of treatment. Three hundred fifty-seven diabetic ketoacidosis patients' charts were reviewed. Fourteen (3.9%) diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) patients had died. Those Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis who had acute comorbidity (presence of sepsis) (AOR = 3.24, 95% CI: 1.20-10.2), international unit (IU) insulin administration in the 1st 24 hours (AOR = 8.046, 95% CI: 3.881-25.32), fluid replacement in the 1st 24 hours (AOR = 5.84, 95% CI: 1.53-10.07), and potassium replacement (AOR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.835-5.817) were independently associated with treatment outcome of diabetic ketoacidosis. Insulin administration for the first 24 hours more than >60 IU insulin showed improvement in treatment outcome by 8.04 times more likely than less <60 IU insulin administration for the first 24 hours. More >6 liters fluid replacement in the first 24 hours had improvement in treatment outcome by 5.84 times more likely than <6 liters fluid replacement. A considerable proportion of the patients with diabetic ketoacidosis died at St. Paul's hospital millennium medical college. Stakeholders must emphasize the treatment of patients with diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis), according to the recommendations of local and international guidelines.",die;improvement and mortality;morbidity;replacement,diabetes
Criteria in the Diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome in Children: A Scoping Review.,"Currently, there is no consensus on the criteria for identifying metabolic syndrome in children, as observed in the diversity of research developed. For this reason, a scoping review was developed in this work, in order to compare the criteria for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (MetS) applied in children, described in observational, descriptive cross-sectional studies. The databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and the search engine Google Scholar were used. The search terms ""metabolic syndrome"", ""cardiometabolic syndrome"", ""child"", ""children"" and ""childhood"" were considered, as well as the names of organizations or authors proposing identification criteria for MetS to establish search relationships using the Boolean connectors ""AND"" and ""OR"". Likewise, two reviewers carried out the evaluation and selection of articles, of which 26 articles were included in which children aged 6 to 12 participated. It was found that the most commonly used criteria for identifying MetS since 2015 are those of Cook et al, IDF, NCEP ATPIII, and De Ferranti et al, in that order. Specific criteria, such as those proposed by Cook et al, are being chosen to enhance the accuracy of identifying MetS in children. The most common risk factors in children with MetS are abdominal circumference and BMI, followed by triglycerides, HDL, blood pressure, and blood glucose. The prevalence of MetS in children varies according to the criteria used, being higher with De Ferranti et al.",child;cholesterol;diagnosis;metabolic syndrome;obesity (thesaurus: DeCS/MeSH);triglycerides,diabetes
Elevated ApoB/apoA-1 is Associated with in-Hospital Mortality in Elderly Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"Apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-1 (apoB/apoA-1) has been shown to be strongly associated with the risk of future cardiovascular disease, but the association between apoB/apoA-1 and the risk of in-hospital death in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction(AMI) is inconclusive. To investigate the association between apoB/apoA-1 and the risk of in-hospital death in elderly patients with AMI. From December 2015 to December 2021, a total of 1495 elderly AMI patients (aged ≥ 60 years) with complete clinical history data were enrolled in the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University. Outcome was defined as all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted spline cubic (RCS) models were used to evaluate the association between apoB/apoA-1 and in-hospital mortality risk, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive value of apoB/apoA-1 for in-hospital mortality events. Discordance analysis was performed when apoB/apoA-1 and LDL-C/HDL-C were not in concordance. (1) A total of 128 patients (8.6%) died during hospitalization. Patients in the death group had higher apoB/apoA-1 than those in the non-death group, but lower apoA-1 levels than those in the non-death group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); (2) Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that apoB/apoA-1 was associated with the risk of in-hospital death in elderly AMI patients [Model 3 OR = 3.524 (1.622-7.659), P = 0.001]; (3) ROC curve analysis showed that apoB/apoA-1 (AUC = 0.572, P = 0.011) had some predictive value for the risk of in-hospital death in elderly AMI patients; (4) RCS models showed a linear dose-response relationship between apoB/apoA-1 and in-hospital death after adjusting for confounders (P for non-linearity = 0.762). ApoB/apoA-1 is associated with the risk of in-hospital death in elderly patients with AMI, and is superior to other blood lipid parameters and blood lipid ratio.",acute myocardial infarction;apolipoprotein;elderly;in-hospital death;restricted cubic splines,diabetes
"Effects of heel apex position, apex angle and rocker radius on plantar pressure in the heel region.","Rocker shoes and insoles are used to prevent diabetic foot ulcers in persons with diabetes mellitus and loss of protective sensation, by reducing the plantar pressure in regions with high pressure values (>200 kPa) (e.g., hallux, metatarsal heads and heel). However, forefoot rocker shoes that reduce pressure in the forefoot inadvertently increase pressure in the heel. No studies focused on mitigating the negative effects on heel pressure by optimizing the heel rocker midsole, yet. Therefore, we analyze the effect of different heel rocker parameters on the heel plantar pressure. In-shoe pressure was measured, while 10 healthy participants walked with control shoe and 10 different heel rocker settings. Peak pressure was determined in 7 heel masks, for all shoes. Generalized estimating equations was performed to test the effect of the different shoes on the peak pressure in the different heel masks. In the proximal heel, a rocker shoe with distal apex position, small rocker radius and large apex angle (100°), shows the largest significant decrease in peak pressure compared to rocker shoes with more proximally located apex positions. In the midheel and distal heel, the same rocker shoes or any other rocker shoes, analyzed in this study, do not reduce the PP more than 2 % compared to the control shoe. For the midheel and distal heel region with high pressure values (>200 kPa), rocker shoes alone are not the correct option to reduce the pressure to below 200 kPa. When using rocker shoes to reduce the pressure in the forefoot, a heel rocker midsole with a distal apex position, small rocker radius and apex angle of 100°, mitigates the negative effects on proximal heel pressure. For the midheel and distal heel, other footwear options as an addition or instead of rocker shoes are needed to reduce the pressure.",Diabetes mellitus;Diabetic foot;Diabetic foot ulcer;Footwear;Heel pressure;Plantar pressure;Prevention;Rocker shoe,diabetes
Hippocampal atrophy is associated with hearing loss in cognitively normal adults.,"A growing body of evidence suggests that age-related hearing loss (HL) is associated with morphological changes of the cerebral cortex, but the results have been drawn from a small amount of data in most studies. The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between HL and gray matter volume (GMV) in a large number of subjects, strictly controlling for an extensive set of possible biases. Medical records of 576 subjects who underwent pure tone audiometry, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the Korean Mini-Mental State Exam (K-MMSE) were reviewed. Among them, subjects with normal cognitive function and free of central nervous system disorders or coronary artery disease were included. Outliers were excluded after a sample homogeneity check. In the end, 405 subjects were enrolled. Pure tone hearing thresholds were determined at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in the better ear. Enrolled subjects were divided into 3 groups according to pure tone average: normal hearing (NH), mild HL (MHL), and moderate-to-severe HL (MSHL) groups. Using voxel-based morphometry, we evaluated GMV changes that may be associated with HL. Sex, age, total intracranial volume, type of MRI scanner, education level, K-MMSE score, smoking status, and presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia were used as covariates. A statistically significant negative correlation between the hearing thresholds and GMV of the hippocampus was elucidated. Additionally, in group comparisons, the left hippocampal GMV of the MSHL group was significantly smaller than that of the NH and MHL groups. Based on the negative correlation between hearing thresholds and hippocampal GMV in cognitively normal old adults, the current study indicates that peripheral deafferentation could be a potential contributing factor to hippocampal atrophy.",aging;atrophy;hearing loss;hippocampus;structural neuroimaging,diabetes
Severe Insulin Resistance in a Patient Treated With Nivolumab and Brentuximab-Vedotin for Hodgkin Lymphoma.,"This is a case of a 26-year-old male patient, with relapsing Hodgkin lymphoma, treated with nivolumab and brentuximab-vedotin, who was admitted with hyperglycemia and severe insulin resistance requiring approximately 2000 units of intravenous insulin per day. He had no prior diagnosis of diabetes. He was eventually diagnosed with massive cytokine release and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis that led to multi-organ failure and death. The mechanisms behind the hyperglycemia with severe insulin resistance remain unclear but are possibly related to hyperinflammation and immune dysregulation resulting from massive cytokine release. Nivolumab among other immunotherapeutic agents, brentuximab-vedotin, and lymphoid malignancies are rare but known risk factors for massive cytokine release and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.",Hodgkin lymphoma;brentuximab-vedotin;cytokine release;hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis;hyperglycemia;immunotherapy;insulin resistance;nivolumab,diabetes
Sex Steroid Modulators and the Development of Buschke-Lowenstein Tumor: A Case Report of an Immunocompetent Patient.,"Buschke-Lowenstein tumors (BLTs) are benign dermatologic manifestations of human papillomavirus (HPV). They originate from longstanding condylomata in individuals with compromised immune systems. In this case report, we present a 68-year-old immunocompetent female with HPV condylomata that had transitioned to a large, fungated BLT in her right groin. The patient's immunocompetency was determined by the absence of diabetes, corticosteroid therapy, organ transplant, cytotoxic therapy, or any known primary or other secondary immunodeficiencies. Notably, the patient had a history of breast cancer, managed through lumpectomy, local radiation, and two years of combined aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) therapy, followed by three years of further SERM therapy. We propose that the effect of her previously received SERM therapy shifted the T helper (Th)1 immune response to a Th2 response. This may have compromised the patient's HPV-specific cell-mediated immunity, favoring a non-protective Th2-dominant effect. Thus, it potentially enabled immune evasion, transitioning to a BLT phenotype. Additionally, the immune skewing of the SERM may have been initially opposed by the known ability of aromatase inhibitors to potentiate Th1 responses. Indeed, the patient first noticed the appearance of HPV condylomata progressing to the BLT phenotype with the cessation of the aromatase inhibitor therapy under the unopposed influence of the SERM. The resultant cytokine milieu may have contributed to the unusual progression to the BLT phenotype in this otherwise immunocompetent patient.",aromatase inhibitor therapy;buschke-lowenstein tumor (blt);cell-mediated immunity;immunity th2;selective estrogen receptor modulator,diabetes
An Unusual Association of Idiopathic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) With Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD).,"Although the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is commonly associated with many lung conditions and drugs used for treating them, no literature describes a direct association between SIADH and interstitial lung disease. This case report discusses a 79-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status following a fall. The patient had clinical symptoms and imaging findings concerning interstitial lung disease (ILD), and laboratory tests from the ER indicated severe hyponatremia and an increased white blood cell count, suggesting an unusual clinical picture. Detailed workup and medication reconciliation revealed no other medical conditions or intake of drugs associated with SIADH; however, the patient's low serum osmolality, high urine osmolality, high urine sodium, and improvement in serum sodium level with the initiation of 0.9% saline, salt tablets, and tolvaptan verify the presence of SIADH. While the association between SIADH and ILD is not well documented in medical literature, a few case reports from different regions have indicated a potential link, either through drug-induced ILD or SIADH resolution coinciding with ILD improvement. Hence, we describe a case of idiopathic SIADH, possibly associated with interstitial lung disease. This case demonstrates the importance of recognizing the coexistence of SIADH and ILD, as severe hyponatremia can lead to potential life-threatening neurological consequences.",hyponatremia;ild;interstitial lung disease;siadh;syndrome of inappropriate adh secretion,diabetes
Brown Tumors of the Jaws: A Retrospective Study.,"(1) Describe the clinical spectrum, imaging features, management, and outcome of brown tumors (BT) of the jaws. (2) Determine via a literature review the facts and controversies around the characteristics and management of this lesion. Our study was approved by the institutional committee of Sahloul University Hospital in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Sixteen patients with BT in the context of a primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism were treated and followed up during their recovery. This study reports 16 patients with a mean age of 48 years old. Brown tumor lesions were associated with primary hyperparathyroidism in 6 cases (38%), secondary hyperparathyroidism to chronic kidney failure in 5 cases (31%), and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in the context of a long lasting CRI in 5 cases. Their location was maxillary in 7 cases, mandibular in 5 cases, and bimaxillary in 4 cases. The treatment consisted of parathyroidectomy in 13 patients, maxillary resection in 3 cases, and vitamin D treatment in 2 cases. Favorable outcomes, characterized by tumor regression, were reported in 9 cases, whereas unfavorable evolution was observed among 7 patients. Parathyroidectomy is the gold standard treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. It resulted in a total regression in all our cases. Regarding secondary hyperparathyroidism, blood screening and chronic renal insufficiency follow-up are critically valuable to detect this condition at an early stage, hence increasing the success rate of brown tumor regression. Our secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism results were miscellaneous; although it is important to emphasize the importance of the chronic renal insufficiency management to ensure a success. Brown tumors should be included in the differential diagnosis of giant cell lesions. Parathyroidectomy is usually sufficient to induce the total regression of the lesion in primary hyperparathyroidism cases. A more delicate approach is needed regarding secondary hyperparathyroidism. Meticulous control of chronic renal insufficiency is mandatory in addition to parathyroidectomy.",Osteitis fibrosa cystica;brown tumors;hyperparathyroidism;parathyroidectomy,diabetes
Acquired perforating dermatosis in patients on peritoneal dialysis: a report of 3 cases.,"Acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) is a heterogeneous group of unfrequented diseases (2.5 cases for 100,000 habitants) associated with multiple pathologies like end-stage renal disease and other concomitant conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM). We described 3 cases of APD in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), one of them with a giant variant of reactive perforating collagenosis (RPC). The first case is a 28-year-old man with chronic kidney disease on PD and a lousy control of disturbances of calcium and phosphorus metabolism that develops an APD. The second case is a 44-year-old man with DM, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on PD, and poor control of disturbances of calcium and phosphorus metabolism that develops an RPC. The third case is a 58-year-old man with DM, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, CKD and bad control of calcium and phosphorus metabolism that develops a giant variant of RPC with poor evolution. CKD and concomitant conditions such as DM present an increased risk of developing APD. Poor control of calcium and phosphorus metabolism is frequently found in patients with CKD and seems to be related to the development of APD in our cases. With the description of these cases, we want to emphasize the importance of knowing this rare disease, in order to promptly refer to Dermatology and start treatment.",Acquired perforating dermatosis (APD);case report;peritoneal dialysis (PD);reactive perforating collagenosis (RPC),diabetes
Two cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis in post-operative period in emergency department: time to be aware-case reports.,"Diabetic patients on metformin therapy may be vulnerable to lactic acidosis during acute illness. This is particularly true since the comorbid conditions among patients with diabetes and the frequent use of renin-angiotensin system blockers increase the risk of renal dysfunction. We present two cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) occurred after abdominal surgery. A 74-year-old woman presented to emergency department (ED) for a transient loss of consciousness. She had vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of appetite in the last 3 days and she had had an abdominal adhesiolysis surgery 12 days before. A 78-year-old man, with history of right hemicolectomy performed 15 days before admission to ED. Patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting). Arterial blood gas analysis showed acidemia (pH 7.031), elevated anion gap (AG), lactate >15.5 mmol/L. Due to the patients' critical condition, vasopressor infusion and fluid resuscitation were started and an urgent continuous veno-venous hemodialysis with citrate and calcium (CVVHD-CiCa) treatment was provided. A promptly differential diagnosis at ED and early treatment with vital support and CVVHD-CiCa enabled the resolution of MALA, which can often be a fatal complication in diabetic patients taking metformin. Close collaboration with the surgical and endocrinological team would be necessary for the management of the postoperative period planning the reintroduction of metformin in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, to avoid the possibility of the onset of MALA.",Lactic acidosis;case report;diabetes mellitus (DM);metformin;surgery,diabetes
"Association between weight variability, weight change and clinical outcomes in hypertension.","The effect of body weight variability (BWV) and body weight change (BWC) in high-risk individuals with hypertension, but without diabetes mellitus (DM) remains unclear. We examined the effect of BWV and BWC on the primary outcome [the composite of myocardial infarction (MI), other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure (HF), or cardiovascular (CV) death] and all-cause mortality in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). In this post-hoc analysis, we used multivariate Cox regression models to examine the risk associated with BWV and BWC for the primary outcome in SPRINT. BWV was defined as the intra-individual average successive variability (ASV). BWC was defined as baseline weight minus final weight. A total of 8714 SPRINT participants (mean age 67.8 ± 9.4 years, 35.1 % women, 58.9 % Whites) with available data on body weight were included. The median follow-up was about 3.9 years (IQR, 3.3-4.4). In multivariable-adjusted Cox models, each 1 unit standard deviation (SD) of BWV was significantly associated with a higher risk for the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, HF, MI, and stroke [HR(95 % CI)]: 1.13 (1.07-1.19; p < 0.0001), 1.22 (1.14-1.30; p < 0.0001), 1.16 (1.07-1.26; p < 0.001), 1.10 (1.00-1.20; p = 0.047), and 1.15 (1.05-1.27; p = 0.005), respectively. Similarly, each 1 unit SD of BWC was significantly associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, MI, and HF: 1.11(1.02-1.21; p = 0.017), 1.44 (1.26-1.65; p < 0.0001), 1.16 (1.01-1.32; p = 0.041) and 1.19 (1.02-1.40; p = 0.031) respectively. However, there was no significant association with CV death (for both BWV and BWC) or stroke (BWC). In high-risk hypertension, BWV and BWC were both associated with higher risk of the primary outcome and all-cause mortality. These results further stress the clinical importance of sustained weight loss and minimizing fluctuations in weight in hypertension.",Clinical outcomes;Hypertension;Weight change;Weight variability,diabetes
Personalized glucose-lowering effect of chiglitazar in type 2 diabetes.,"Chiglitazar (carfloglitazar) is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pan-agonist presenting non-inferior glucose-lowering efficacy with sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes. To delineate the subgroup of patients with greater benefit from chiglitazar, we conducted a machine learning-based post-hoc analysis in two randomized controlled trials. We established a character phenomap based on 13 variables and estimated HbA1c decline to the effects of chiglitazar in reference to sitagliptin. Out of 1,069 patients, 63.3% were found to have greater reduction in HbA1c levels with chiglitazar, while 36.7% showed greater reduction with sitagliptin. This distinction in treatment response was statistically significant between groups (pinteraction<0.001). To identify patients who would gain the most glycemic control benefit from chiglitazar, we developed a machine learning model, ML-PANPPAR, which demonstrated robust performance using sex, BMI, HbA1c, HDL, and fasting insulin. The phenomapping-derived tool successfully identified chiglitazar responders and enabled personalized drug allocation in patients with drug-naïve diabetes.",Clinical endocrinology;Endocrinology;Human metabolism;Machine learning,diabetes
Severe acute kidney injury in a patient with renal artery stenosis of a single-functioning kidney: A case report of rapid normalisation of the renal function after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent placement.,"Revascularisation of renal arterial stenosis in acute settings, such as uncontrolled arterial hypertension, flash pulmonary oedema and/or acute renal failure, has shown controversial results in observational and prospective studies. Current guidelines do not recommend revascularisation in the occurrence of renal failure as revascularisation and best medical treatment have shown similar long-term outcomes on renal function. We describe a case of acute degradation of the renal function (with oligo-anuria and a peak creatinine of 462 µmol/L) after the re-introduction of an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (irbesartan) in a 66-year-old Caucasian diabetic male patient with bilateral renal stenosis and a right-sided single-functioning kidney, with a rapid improvement of the renal function which normalized 5 days after percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of the right renal artery.",Acute renal failure;acute kidney injury;angiotensin receptor blocker;percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent placement;renal artery stenosis;single-functioning kidney,diabetes
Risk Factors for Single and Multiple Recurrences for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography and Open Choledochotomy in Treating Choledocholithiasis.,"There are few studies comparing recurrences between endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and open choledochotomy (OCT). To compare the effect of different surgical methods on single and multiple recurrences of choledocholithiasis. A total of 1255 patients with choledocholithiasis who underwent ERCP or OCT were retrospectively studied. The recurrence of choledocholithiasis was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. Multivariate analyses of recurrent choledocholithiasis were performed by introducing variables with P < 0.20 in univariate analysis into the logistic regression model. A total of 204 (16.7%, 204/1225) patients relapsed. Among the 204 patients, 74.5% relapsed within three years after surgery, of whom 39.7% (81/204) had multiple relapses (≥ 2). The recurrence rate of ERCP (17.2%, 119/692) was higher than that of OCT (15.1%, 85/563), but the difference was not statistically significant. The independent risk factors for a single recurrence of choledocholithiasis were diabetes, stone number ≥ 2, maximum stone diameter ≥ 15 mm, sedentary occupation, the approach of ERCP (EST or EPBD), periampullary diverticulum, primary suture, high-fat diet (postoperative), frequency of weekly vegetable intake (< 4, postoperative), and drinking (postoperative). However, the ERCP approach (EST or EPBD), OCT approach (LCBDE), primary suture, high-fat diet (postoperative), and frequency of weekly vegetable intake (< 4, postoperative) were independent risk factors for multiple recurrences of choledocholithiasis. Patients with choledocholithiasis should be followed up regularly for one to three years after treatment. Stone number ≥ 2, diabetes mellitus, periampullary diverticulum, surgical methods, and lifestyle are all risk factors for the recurrence of choledocholithiasis. ERCP is still the preferred surgical method based on the advantages of low risk of cholangitis recurrence, less hospital stay, minimally invasive surgery, fewer postoperative complications, and easier acceptance by elderly patients. In addition to optimizing the treatment plans, postoperative lifestyle management is also vital.",,diabetes

FoxO1 as a tissue-specific therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.,"Forkhead box O (FoxO) proteins are transcription factors that mediate many aspects of physiology and thus have been targeted as therapeutics for several diseases including metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The role of FoxO1 in metabolism has been well studied, but recently FoxO1's potential for diabetes prevention and therapy has been debated. For example, studies have shown that increased FoxO1 activity in certain tissue types contributes to T2D pathology, symptoms, and comorbidities, yet in other tissue types elevated FoxO1 has been reported to alleviate symptoms associated with diabetes. Furthermore, studies have reported opposite effects of active FoxO1 in the same tissue type. For example, in the liver, FoxO1 contributes to T2D by increasing hepatic glucose production. However, FoxO1 has been shown to either increase or decrease hepatic lipogenesis as well as adipogenesis in white adipose tissue. In skeletal muscle, FoxO1 reduces glucose uptake and oxidation, promotes lipid uptake and oxidation, and increases muscle atrophy. While many studies show that FoxO1 lowers pancreatic insulin production and secretion, others show the opposite, especially in response to oxidative stress and inflammation. Elevated FoxO1 in the hypothalamus increases the risk of developing T2D. However, increased FoxO1 may mitigate Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease strongly associated with T2D. Conversely, accumulating evidence implicates increased FoxO1 with Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Here we review FoxO1's actions in T2D conditions in metabolic tissues that abundantly express FoxO1 and highlight some of the current studies targeting FoxO1 for T2D treatment.","D006801:Humans;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D019636:Neurodegenerative Diseases;D051858:Forkhead Transcription Factors;D007328:Insulin;D007333:Insulin Resistance",diabetes
Insulin-like growth factors and aging: lessons from Laron syndrome.,"The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signaling pathway emerged in recent years as a key determinant of aging and longevity. Disruption of this network in different animal species, including flies, nematodes and mouse, was consistently associated with an extended lifespan. Epidemiological analyses have shown that patients with Laron syndrome (LS), the best-characterized disease under the umbrella of the congenital IGF1 deficiencies, seem to be protected from cancer. While aging and cancer, as a rule, are considered diametrically opposite processes, modern lines of evidence reinforce the notion that aging and cancer might, as a matter of fact, be regarded as divergent manifestations of identical biochemical and cellular underlying processes. While the effect of individual mutations on lifespan and health span is very difficult to assess, genome-wide screenings identified a number of differentially represented aging- and longevity-associated genes in patients with LS. The present review summarizes recent data that emerged from comprehensive analyses of LS patients and portrays a number of previously unrecognized targets for GH-IGF1 action. Our article sheds light on complex aging and longevity processes, with a particular emphasis on the role of the GH-IGF1 network in these mechanisms.",D006801:Humans;D051379:Mice;D000818:Animals;D046150:Laron Syndrome;D000375:Aging;D008136:Longevity;D013006:Growth Hormone;D019382:Human Growth Hormone;D009369:Neoplasms,diabetes
Serum mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases in early pregnancy for gestational diabetes in Chinese pregnant women.,"This study aimed to explore associations of mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP) levels in early pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We also examined interactions of MASPs and deoxycholic acid (DCA)/glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) for the GDM risk and whether the interactive effects if any on the GDM risk were mediated via lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 18:0. A 1:1 case-control study (n = 414) nested in a prospective cohort of pregnant women was conducted in Tianjin, China. Binary conditional logistic regressions were performed to examine associations of MASPs with the GDM risk. Additive interaction measures were used to examine interactions between MASPs and DCA/GUDCA for the GDM risk. Mediation analyses and Sobel tests were used to examine mediation effects of LPC18:0 between the copresence of MASPs and DCA/GUDCA on the GDM risk. High MASP-2 was independently associated with GDM [odds ratio (OR): 2.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.44-4.77], while the effect of high MASP-1 on GDM was attributable to high MASP-2 (P for Sobel test: 0.003). Low DCA markedly increased the OR of high MASP-2 alone from 2.53 (1.10-5.85) up to 10.6 (4.22-26.4), with a significant additive interaction. In addition, high LPC18:0 played a significant mediating role in the links from low DCA to GDM and from the copresence of high MASP-2 and low DCA to GDM (P for Sobel test <0.001) but not in the link from high MASP-2 to GDM. High MASP-1 and MASP-2 in early pregnancy were associated with GDM in Chinese pregnant women. MASP-2 amplifies the risk of low DCA for GDM, which is mediated via LPC18:0.","D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D011247:Pregnancy;D050606:Mannose-Binding Protein-Associated Serine Proteases;D016640:Diabetes, Gestational;D037601:Mannose-Binding Lectin;D037841:Pregnant Women;D016022:Case-Control Studies;D000095225:East Asian People;D011446:Prospective Studies",diabetes
Associations of advanced liver fibrosis with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in type 2 diabetic patients according to obesity and metabolic goal achievement status.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is frequently coexisted with obesity, poor glycemic, blood pressure (BP), and/or lipid control. We aimed to investigate the associations of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its advanced fibrosis with HFpEF according to obesity, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BP, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal achievement status in T2DM patients. A total of 2,418 T2DM patients who were hospitalized were cross-sectionally assessed. Liver fibrosis was evaluated by non-invasive biomarkers. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent and combined associations of fibrosis status and diabetic care goal attainments with HFpEF risk. Simple steatosis was not associated with HFpEF risk compared with patients without steatosis, while advanced liver fibrosis was found to have significantly higher odds for HFpEF risk (odds ratio,1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.08). Advanced fibrosis in NAFLD was significantly associated with an increased risk of HFpEF, regardless of obesity status, HbA1c, BP, and LDL-C goal achievement status. P values for the interactions between fibrosis status and HbA1c control status, fibrosis status and BP control status, fibrosis status and LDL-C control status, and fibrosis status and body mass index (BMI) status on HFpEF risk were 0.021, 0.13, 0.001, and 0.23, respectively. In patients with T2DM, advanced hepatic fibrosis was significantly associated with HFpEF risk, irrespective of obesity status, HbA1c, BP, and LDL-C goal attainment status. Further, HbA1c and LDL-C goal attainment status modified this association.","D006801:Humans;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D065626:Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease;D006333:Heart Failure;D013318:Stroke Volume;D006442:Glycated Hemoglobin;D008078:Cholesterol, LDL;D006040:Goals;D008103:Liver Cirrhosis;D009765:Obesity",diabetes
"A Systematic Review of Phytochemistry, Nutritional Composition, and Pharmacologic Application of Species of the Genus ","Viola L. is the largest genus of the Violaceae family with more than 500 species across the globe. The present extensive literature survey revealed Viola species to be a group of important nutritional and medicinal plants used for the ethnomedicinal treatment of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, asthma, lung diseases, and fatigue. Many plant species of this genus have also received scientific validation of their pharmacological activities including neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, anticancer, antihypertensive, antidyslipidemic, analgesic, antipyretic, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anthelmintic, and antioxidant. Viola is highly rich in different natural products some of which have been isolated and identified in the past few decades; these include flavonoids terpenoids and phenylpropanoids of different pharmacological activities. The pharmacokinetics and clinical studies on this genus are lacking, and the present review is aimed at summarizing the current understanding of the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, nutritional composition, and pharmacological profile of medicinal plants from the Viola genus to reveal its therapeutic potentials, gaps, and subsequently open a new window for future pharmacological research.",,diabetes
Comparison of Risk Factors During First and Second Wave of COVID-19 in Patients with Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases (AIRD): Results from KRACC Subset.,"The differential influence and outcome of various risk factors on occurrence of COVID-19 among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) during different COVID-19 peaks is underreported. To assess the impact and outcome of conventional risk factors, immunosuppressants, and comorbidities on the risk of COVID-19 among AIRD patients during the first two COVID-19 peaks. Prospective, non-interventional longitudinal cohort study. This is a subset of the KRA COVID19 cohort undertaken during the initial wave of COVID-19 (W1) (Apr-Dec2021); and the 2nd-wave (W2) (Jan-Aug2021). Data collected included description of AIRD subsets, treatment characteristics, comorbidities, and COVID-19 occurrence. Risk factors associated with mortality were analysed. The incidence rate was compared with that of the general population in the same geographic region. AIRD patients (n=2969) had a higher incidence of COVID-19 in the W2 (7.1%) than in the W1 (1.7%) as compared to the general population (Government bulletin). Age (p<0.01) and duration of AIRD (p<0.001) influenced COVID-19 occurrence in W2 while major disease subsets and immunosuppressants including glucocorticoids did not. The W2 had lower HCQ usage (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]-0.81) and comorbidities like hypertension (AOR -0.54) and pre-existing lung disease (AOR -0.38;0.19-0.75) compared to W1. Older age (1.11) and coexistent diabetes mellitus (AOR 6.74) were independent risk factors associated with mortality in W2. We report 1.7 times higher occurrence, and no influence of major disease subsets or immunosuppressants including glucocorticoids on COVID-19.

Evaluation of Early Screening for Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy with Hemoglobin A1c.,"Early diabetes screening is recommended for high-risk pregnant women risk via a 1-hour glucose challenge test (1-hour GCT). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) can be obtained with initial obstetric laboratories. We sought to examine the relationship between HbA1c and 1-hour GCT for early diabetes screening in pregnancy. This is a retrospective cohort study of 204 high-risk pregnant women who underwent early HbA1c and 1-hour GCT. Simple logistic regression analysis was performed to predict abnormal 1-hour GCT and diagnosis of diabetes using HbA1c. A total of 158 (77.5%), 44 (21.5%), and 2 (1%) women had HbA1c of less than 5.7, 5.7 to 6.4, and 6.5% or higher, respectively. Seven of 158 (4.4%) women with HbA1c less than 5.7% and 8 of 44 (18.2%) with HbA1c of 5.7 to 6.4% had a diagnosis of diabetes. A positive correlation between early HbA1c and 1-hour GCT was detected. Logistic regression showed HbA1c significantly predicted the risk of diabetes but was not a good predictor of abnormal 1-hour GCT. HbA1c of 5.5% or less had a 97% or higher negative predictive value for early diabetes in pregnancy. There is a positive correlation between HbA1c and 1-hour GCT for the early screening of diabetes in pregnancy. Women with early HbA1c ≤ 5.5% could forego further testing in early pregnancy.",diabetes;glucose challenge test;hemoglobin A1c;pregnancy;screening,diabetes
Wellbeing and distress in young people with chronic conditions: how do positive psychology variables relate to mental health outcomes?,"The aim of this study was to determine the unique and shared contributions of various positive psychology constructs (gratitude, optimism, hope, self-compassion, self-efficacy, and emotion regulation) to wellbeing and distress outcomes in young people living with a diverse range of chronic health conditions. 169 Australians (84.0% female, mean age = 21.2) who reported living with a chronic physical condition completed a cross-sectional survey assessing wellbeing, distress, and each positive psychology variable. Two multiple regressions were used to determine the unique and shared contributions of the positive psychology variables to wellbeing and distress outcomes. When considered alongside symptom severity, the variables explained 53.4% and 38.1% of variance in distress and wellbeing, respectively. Only optimism and self-efficacy accounted for unique and significant variance in the model predicting wellbeing, accounting for 6.1% and 4.6% of unique variance, respectively. For the distress model, optimism, self-compassion, and emotion regulation each accounted for significant variance. When considered alongside other variables, hope and gratitude did not contribute to either model. Findings suggest that individual positive psychology variables differentially contribute to wellbeing and distress outcomes in young people with chronic conditions. Optimism appears to account for unique variance in both outcomes, suggesting it may be a parsimonious target to promote complete mental health in this population.",Positive psychology;chronic conditions;wellbeing;youth,diabetes
Association between History of Vaccination and Symptoms at Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"We investigated the association between history of vaccination for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and symptoms at its diagnosis. We retrospectively analyzed 2566 consecutive individuals suspected of having COVID-19 and visited a designated clinic between January and September 2022 (1733 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 816 tested negative for COVID-19) in Japan. The individuals were divided by vaccination history for COVID-19. In the COVID-19-free individuals, the vaccination was not significantly associated with any symptoms. Contrarily, those with COVID-19 demonstrated an inverse relationship between the vaccination and body temperature; the adjusted mean value was higher by 0.01°C, 0.04°C, 0.09°C, 0.27°C, and 0.34°C and 0.48°C in individuals vaccinated 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and >10 months before and those unvaccinated, respectively, than in those vaccinated within 2 months (P = 0.96, 0.41, 0.081, 0.006, 0.004, and <0.001). Furthermore, among the affected population, individuals vaccinated long before or never vaccinated more frequently complained of fatigue and headache; the adjusted odds ratios of those vaccinated >10 months before and those unvaccinated compared with those vaccinated within 2 months were 2.53 and 2.45 for fatigue and 2.53 and 2.17 for headache (all P < 0.05). Contrarily, the prevalence of rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough was higher in recently vaccinated individuals (adjusted odds ratios of those vaccinated within 2 months versus those unvaccinated, 2.40, 2.46, and 2.46; all P < 0.05). Symptoms at the COVID-19 diagnosis differed with the vaccination history.

Telemedicine for Pregnant Women on a Japanese Remote Island: A Two-year Report.,"Remote antenatal checkups were conducted on the northernmost island of Japan to reduce the burden of hospital visits among pregnant women. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of remote antenatal checkups for pregnant women living on a remote island. This observational study included singleton pregnancies on Rebun Island between October 2020 and September 2022. General surgeons conducted medical interviews and performed fetal sonography using an obstetrician videoconference system at the main central hospital. The primary outcomes were the degrees of physical, mental, and economic burdens of hospital visits and the levels of anxiety and satisfaction with remote antenatal checkups as assessed using a questionnaire survey. Moreover, we investigated the incidence of adverse perinatal events, including maternal death, fetal death, neonatal death, severe neonatal neurological disorders, and other obstetric complications. This study included 16 out of 22 pregnant women from Rebun Island who visited the central hospital. No adverse perinatal events occurred as a result of the remote antenatal checkups. One pregnant woman had gestational diabetes, whereas the others had no obstetric complications. The participants underwent a median of two remote antenatal checkups. According to a questionnaire survey, 90.0%, 80.0%, and 70.0% of the pregnant women perceived improvements in their physical, mental, and economic burdens, respectively. Although 70.0% of the participants experienced anxiety regarding remote antenatal checkups before the introduction, all were satisfied after delivery. Remote antenatal checkups effectively reduced the burden of hospital visits for pregnant women, who reported high levels of satisfaction. Furthermore, antenatal checkups were safely conducted on remote islands.",antenatal care;maternal health service;pregnancy;telemedicine;ultrasonography,diabetes
The association between masticatory ability and lower Timed Up & Go Test performance among community-dwelling Japanese aging men and women: The Toon Health Study.,"Few studies examined the association between deterioration of masticatory ability assessed by objective marker and physical function. Therefore, we examined the association between salivary flow rate which is one of the objective and surrogate marker of masticatory ability and lower Timed Up & Go (TUG) performance which is one of major measurement of physical function among aging Japanese. This cross-sectional study enrolled 464 Japanese aged 60-84 years old. Participants chewed tasteless and odorless gum for 5 min, calculated stimulated salivary flow rate (g/min) during all chews. The 3 m TUG was conducted, and 75th percentile value (6.8 s for men and 7.0 s for women) or higher was defined as lower TUG performance. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between stimulated salivary flow rate and lower TUG performance. We found that the stimulated salivary flow rate tended to be negatively associated with the TUG time. We also observed significant negative association between stimulated salivary flow rate and lower TUG performance; the multivariable-adjusted OR (95% confidence interval, CIs) of lower TUG performance for the highest quartile of stimulated salivary flow rate compared with the lowest quartile was 0.34 (0.16-0.69, P for trend = 0.02). Further adjusting for BMI, the association was attenuated but remaind significant; the OR (95% CIs) in highest quartile was 0.37 (0.18-0.76, P for trend = 0.04). Higher stimulated salivary flow, which means well masticatory ability, was inversely associated with lower TUG performance in the aging Japanese population.",Aging Japanese population;Stimulated salivary flow rate;TUG performance,diabetes
Long-term outcomes and adverse effects of teduglutide in patients with short bowel syndrome: Highlighting hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia.,"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles, AJHP is posting manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Short bowel syndrome is a malabsorptive condition that occurs due to surgical removal or a congenital absence of a significant portion of the small intestine. Patients with short bowel syndrome often rely on parenteral support for extended periods or even their entire lives. Teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-2 analog, has shown promising results in reducing dependency on parenteral support in these patients by promoting intestinal adaptation and enhancing nutrient absorption. However, the long-term safety of teduglutide remains a concern, particularly with respect to its potential for the development of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. This study involved patients who received teduglutide from December 2012 to December 2022 at Boston Medical Center. We evaluated outcomes and adverse events, focusing on hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia, through chart review. Thirteen eligible patients were identified who had used teduglutide. Of these, the majority (84.6%) experienced a reduction in parenteral support. A high incidence (72.7%) of nonpathological pancreatic enzyme elevation was observed in patients treated with teduglutide. These elevations were often dose dependent and were not associated with any clinical signs of acute pancreatitis or abnormal imaging findings. This study highlights the need for further investigations into the long-term safety of teduglutide and the importance of closely monitoring amylase and lipase levels in patients undergoing treatment with teduglutide.",adverse effect;amylase;lipase;short bowel syndrome;teduglutide,diabetes
Branch retinal artery occlusion with unruptured retinal arterial macroaneurysm post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: A case report.,"Many adverse occurrences in the eye have been reported after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. This is the first report of a patient with an unruptured retinal arterial macroaneurysm (RAM) who developed branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) one day after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (BNT162b2 by Pfizer-BioNTech). A 75-year-old man with a pertinent history of type-2 diabetes mellitus visited the hospital complaining of sudden visual loss in his right eye 1 day after receiving the fourth dose of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine; his best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) decreased from 1.0 to 0.7 (Snellen decimal). The patient had previously been diagnosed with an unruptured RAM and superior paracentral acute middle maculopathy in the same eye. Fundus examination showed increased sheathing of blood vessels. Indocyanine green showed a hyperfluorescent area suggestive of RAM on the right eye disc. Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography angiography revealed arterial obstruction findings in the upper retinal area. The patient was diagnosed with BRAO with RAM and was followed up without any additional treatment. Follow-up examination after 4 months did not show any improvement in BCVA value. This case suggested that BRAO could develop after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with unruptured RAM; however, more research is required to investigate the causes.",Venous occlusive disease < RETINA;adverse effects of electromagnetic energy < RETINA;arterial occlusive disease < RETINA;retinal pathology / research < RETINA;retinal telangietasias/macroaneurysms < RETINA,diabetes

Knowledge of the health consequences of heavy alcohol consumption among individuals with different substance use statuses: A cross-sectional analysis of 2019 HINT Survey.,"The aim of this study was to assess and compare knowledge of the health consequences of heavy alcohol consumption among individuals with different substance use statuses. We used a cross-sectional study design to analyze the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5, Cycle 3 (2019). Participants were classified into four categories based on their substance use status: (a) nonsmoker and nondrinkers; (b) nonsmokers but drinkers; (c) smokers but nondrinkers; and (d) smokers and drinkers. Weighted logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the association between knowledge of heavy alcohol consumption and health conditions by participants' substance use status. More than 79% of participants were aware that drinking too much alcohol causes liver disease. However, less than 40% of them realized that heavy alcohol consumption also contributes to cancer. The odds of correctly identifying heavy alcohol consumption as a risk factor for diabetes were 3.00 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29,7.00) higher among smokers but nondrinkers than smokers and alcohol drinkers. Education level was significantly associated with participants' awareness of risk factor (p < 0.01). There is an urgent need for targeted educational campaigns and interventions to increase understanding of the impact of heavy alcohol consumption on cancer risk.",alcohol;cancer;diabetes;smokers; Knowledge,diabetes
"Effects of CB1R inverse agonist, INV-202, in patients with features of metabolic syndrome. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1b study.","To evaluate the clinical safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the novel cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) inverse agonist, INV-202, in adults with features of metabolic syndrome. This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 28-day repeat-dose (INV-202 [25 mg] or placebo, once-daily oral tablet), parallel-group study in 37 participants aged 18 to 65 years (46% female, mean age 55 years, glycated haemoglobin 5.7% [39 mmol/mol], body mass index [BMI] 38.1 kg/m2 ) with features of metabolic syndrome and glucose intolerance. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Lipid profiles, weight, waist circumference and biomarkers were assessed weekly. Statistical comparisons were performed post hoc. INV-202 was well tolerated with no serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events; the most common events related to known effects of CB1R blockade in the gastrointestinal tract. INV-202 produced a significant mean weight loss of 3.5 kg (3.3% compared with placebo participants who gained a mean 0.6 kg [0.5%]). INV-202 also exhibited significant reductions in waist circumference and BMI (P ≤ 0.03). There was no significant difference in OGTT 0- to 3-hour area under the curve for INV-202 versus placebo: least squares mean 29.38 versus 30.25 h*mmol/L, with an INV-202: placebo ratio of 97.1% (95% confidence interval 90.2, 105.6; P = 0.43).

Emerging trends and hotspots in the links between the bile acids and NAFLD from 2002 to 2022: A bibliometric analysis.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic syndrome of the liver, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that bile acids are associated with NAFLD. Although many studies on bile acids and NAFLD have been published over the past 20 years, the authors of this study have not found a relevant bibliometric analysis in this field. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the trend of publications, summarize current research hotspots and predict future research directions through bibliometric analysis in this field. Articles related to bile acids and NAFLD published between 2002 and 2022 were obtained from the Science Citation Index-Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection. Microsoft Excel, CiteSpace, VOSviewer and Bibliometric Online Analysis Platform were used to analyse the publication trends and research hotspots in this field. Among the articles published between 2002 and 2022, we retrieved 1284 articles related to bile acids and NAFLD, and finally included 568 articles. The USA was dominant until 2020, after which China surpassed the USA to become the dominant force. These two countries cooperate the most closely, and are also the most active in international cooperation. The University of California (UCL) was the most published institution, with a total of 31 publications. There were six authors who have published nine articles and ranked first.

"Improved endurance capacity of diabetic mice during SGLT2 inhibition: Role of AICARP, an AMPK activator in the soleus.","Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of deleterious changes in muscle mass and function or sarcopenia, leading to physical inactivity and worsening glycaemic control. Given the negative energy balance during sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition, whether SGLT2 inhibitors affect skeletal muscle mass and function is a matter of concern. However, how SGLT2 inhibition affects the skeletal muscle function in patients with diabetes remains insufficiently explored. We aimed to explore the effects of canagliflozin (CANA), an SGLT2 inhibitor, on skeletal muscles in genetically diabetic db/db mice focusing on the differential responses of oxidative and glycolytic muscles. Db/db mice were treated with CANA for 4 weeks. We measured running distance and handgrip strength to assess skeletal muscle function during CANA treatment. At the end of the experiment, we performed a targeted metabolome analysis of the skeletal muscles. CANA treatment improved the reduced endurance capacity, as revealed by running distance in db/db mice (414.9 ± 52.8 vs. 88.7 ± 22.7 m, P < 0.05). Targeted metabolome analysis revealed that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate (AICARP), a naturally occurring AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, increased in the oxidative soleus muscle (P < 0.05), but not in the glycolytic extensor digitorum longus muscle (P = 0.4376), with increased levels of AMPK phosphorylation (P < 0.01). This study highlights the potential role of the AICARP/AMPK pathway in oxidative rather than glycolytic skeletal muscles during SGLT2 inhibition, providing novel insights into the mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors improve endurance capacity in patients with type 2 diabetes.",AICARP;AMPK;SGLT2 inhibitor;endurance exercise;fatty acid oxidation;skeletal muscle,diabetes
Incorporation of patient and public involvement in statistical methodology research: development of an animation.,"Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) is important to all aspects of health research. However, there are few examples of successful PPIE in statistical methodology research. One of the reasons for this relates to challenges in the identification of individuals interested in statistical methodology research projects, and ambiguities over the importance of PPIE to these projects. This project was conducted between August 2022 and August 2023. The aim is to report the process of the development of an accessible animation to describe what statistical methodology is and the importance of PPIE in statistical methodology research projects. For this, we combined storyboarding and scriptwriting with feedback from PPIE members and researchers. After three stages that incorporated feedback from the relevant stakeholders, we produced a final animation about PPIE in statistical methodology. The resulting animation used minimal text, simple animation techniques and was of short duration (< 3 min) to optimise the communication of the key messages clearly and effectively. The resulting animation provides a starting point for members of the public to learn about PPIE in statistical methodology research and for methodologists who wish to conduct PPIE. We recommend further work to explore ways in which members of the public can be more meaningfully involved in methodology research.",Animation;Communication;Involvement;Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE);Public health;Statistical methodology research;Visualisation,diabetes
Monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio predicts poor outcomes in ischaemic heart failure patients combined with diabetes: a retrospective study.,"The prevalence of ischaemic heart failure (HF) continues to increase. Diabetes mellitus (DM) concomitant with ischaemic HF increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). As a promising predictor for cardiovascular diseases, the predictive value of the monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) for MACE in the ischaemic HF with DM cohort has never been investigated before. We aimed to investigate the MHR as a predictor for MACE in ischaemic HF patients with DM who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This observational study enrolled 1049 patients with ischaemic HF and DM undergoing PCI from June 2017 to June 2019. The baseline data were collected. MACEs, including all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and any revascularization, were recorded within the 36-month follow-up. The characteristics and incidence of MACE were analysed in four groups stratified by the quartiles of MHR. The hazard ratio for MACE was analysed with Cox regression models. The incidence of MACE in the four groups was evaluated by Kaplan‒Meier survival analysis. Restricted cubic spline analysis was performed to determine the nonlinear correlation between the MHR and MACE. After the 36-month follow-up, 407 patients (38.8%) experienced MACEs. The incidence of MACE was significantly higher among patients in the upper MHR quartile than among those in the lower MHR quartiles (23.4% vs. 36.0% vs. 41.4% and 54.6%; P < 0.001, respectively), which was consistent with the Kaplan‒Meier survival analyses (P < 0.0001). A multivariate Cox regression model showed that the MHR was an independent risk factor for MACE after variables were adjusted (adjusted HR: 2.11; 95% CI 1.47-3.03; P < 0.001). Its predictive effects on MACE showed no interaction with hypercholesterolemia (P > 0.05). The MHR was a significant and independent predictor of MACEs in ischaemic HF patients with DM undergoing PCI.","D006801:Humans;D008076:Cholesterol, HDL;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D062645:Percutaneous Coronary Intervention;D009000:Monocytes;D003920:Diabetes Mellitus;D012307:Risk Factors;D009203:Myocardial Infarction;D006333:Heart Failure",diabetes
Ensuring Indigenous co-leadership in health research: a Can-SOLVE CKD case example.,"Indigenous people are insightful and informed about their own health and wellness, yet their visions, strengths and knowledge are rarely incorporated into health research. This can lead to subpar engagement or irrelevant research practices, which exacerbates the existing health inequities Indigenous people experience compared to the non-Indigenous population. Data consistently underscores the importance of Indigenous self-determination in research as a means to address health inequities. However, there are few formal methods to support this goal within the existing research context, which is dominated by Western perspectives. Canadians Seeking Solutions and Innovations to Overcome Chronic Kidney Disease (Can-SOLVE CKD) is a patient-oriented research network in Canada that recognizes the need to create the space to facilitate Indigenous self-determination in research. Indigenous members of the network therefore created and evolved a unique group, called the Indigenous Peoples' Engagement and Research Council (IPERC). IPERC plays a critical role in informing Can-SOLVE CKD research priorities, as well as creating tools to support Indigenous-specific research and engagement. This approach ensures that Indigenous voices and knowledge are critical threads within the fabric of the network's operations and research projects. Here, we describe the methods taken to create a council such as IPERC, and provide examples of initiatives by the council that aim to increase Indigenous representation, participation and partnership in research. We share lessons learned on what factors contribute to the success of IPERC, which could be valuable for other organizations interested in creating Indigenous-led research councils. Indigenous self-determination in research is critical for addressing health inequities. Here, we present a unique model, led by a council of diverse Indigenous people, which could help reduce health equities and lead to a better era of research for everyone.","D006801:Humans;D007857:Leadership;D002170:Canada;D000069576:Health Equity;D051436:Renal Insufficiency, Chronic;D000081034:Indigenous Peoples;D006303:Health Services, Indigenous",diabetes
"Roles of gut microbiota in atrial fibrillation: insights from Mendelian randomization analysis and genetic data from over 430,000 cohort study participants.","Gut microbiota imbalances have been suggested as a contributing factor to atrial fibrillation (AF), but the causal relationship is not fully understood. To explore the causal relationships between the gut microbiota and AF using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Summary statistics were from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 207 gut microbial taxa (5 phyla, 10 classes, 13 orders, 26 families, 48 genera, and 105 species) (the Dutch Microbiome Project) and two large meta-GWASs of AF. The significant results were validated in FinnGen cohort and over 430,000 UK Biobank participants. Mediation MR analyses were conducted for AF risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), body mass index (BMI), blood lipids, blood pressure, and obstructive sleep apnea, to explore the potential mediation effect of these risk factors in between the gut microbiota and AF. Two microbial taxa causally associated with AF: species Eubacterium ramulus (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.12, P = 0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value = 0.023) and genus Holdemania (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.25, P = 0.0004, FDR adjusted p-value = 0.042). Genus Holdemania was associated with incident AF risk in the UK Biobank. The proportion of mediation effect of species Eubacterium ramulus via CAD was 8.05% (95% CI 1.73% - 14.95%, P = 0.008), while the proportion of genus Holdemania on AF via BMI was 12.01% (95% CI 5.17% - 19.39%, P = 0.0005). This study provided genetic evidence to support a potential causal mechanism between gut microbiota and AF and suggested the mediation role of AF risk factors.","D006801:Humans;D001281:Atrial Fibrillation;D000069196:Gastrointestinal Microbiome;D057182:Mendelian Randomization Analysis;D015331:Cohort Studies;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D055106:Genome-Wide Association Study;D003324:Coronary Artery Disease",diabetes
Triglycerides/HDL cholesterol ratio and type 2 diabetes incidence: Panasonic Cohort Study 10.,"Previous studies have investigated the association between the ratio of triglycerides (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the incidence of diabetes in adults and discovered that a high TG/HDL-C ratio was linked to an elevated risk of new-onset diabetes. However, the comparison of predicting diabetes development among lipid profiles including the TG/HDL-C ratio, and the ratio of TG/HDL-C cut-off value has received limited attention. We examined the relationship between diabetes onset and the TG/HDL-C ratio in addition to the applicable cut-off value for predicting diabetes onset. This study included 120,613 participants from the health examination database at Panasonic Corporation from 2008 to 2017. Cox regression analysis employing multivariable models was used to investigate the association between lipid profiles, particularly the ratio of TG/HDL-C and the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The multivariable model was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, systolic blood pressure, plasma glucose levels after fasting, smoking status, and exercise habits. Areas under time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) were employed to assess the prediction performance and cut-off values of each indicator. A fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL, a self-reported history of diabetes, or usage of antidiabetic medicines were used to identify T2D. During the course of the study, 6,080 people developed T2D. The median follow-up duration was 6.0 (3-10) years. Multivariable analysis revealed that the ratio of TG/HDL-C (per unit, HR; 1.03 [95% CI 1.02-1.03]) was substantially linked to the risk of incident T2D. AUC and cut-off points for the ratio of TG/HDL-C for T2D development after 10 years were 0.679 and 2.1, respectively. Furthermore, the AUC of the ratio of TG/HDL-C was considerably larger compared to that of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG alone (all P < 0.001). We discovered an interaction effect between sex, BMI, and lipid profiles in subgroup analysis. Females and participants having a BMI of < 25 kg/m2 showed a higher correlation between lipid profile levels and T2D onset. The ratio of TG/HDL-C was found to be a stronger predictor of T2D development within 10 years than LDL-C, HDL-C, or TG, indicating that it may be useful in future medical treatment support.","D000328:Adult;D005260:Female;D006801:Humans;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D014280:Triglycerides;D008076:Cholesterol, HDL;D015331:Cohort Studies;D008078:Cholesterol, LDL;D001786:Blood Glucose;D015415:Biomarkers",diabetes
Impact of Treviamet® & Treviamet XR® on quality of life besides glycemic control in type 2 DM patients.,"Maintaining the quality of life is the main objective of managing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (QoL). Since it is a key factor in patient motivation and adherence, treatment-related QoL has always been considered when choosing glucose-lowering medicines. The objective of the study was to evaluate the quality of life besides glycemic control among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients receiving Treviamet® & Treviamet XR® (Sitagliptin with Metformin) in routine care. It was a prospective, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial including T2DM patients uncontrolled on Metformin therapy. All patients received Treviamet® & Treviamet XR® for six months. Sequential changes in QoL, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure were monitored from baseline to 3 consecutive follow-up visits. The frequency of adverse events (AEs) was also noted throughout the study. A total of 504 patients were screened; 188 completed all three follow-ups. The mean QoL score significantly declined from 57.09% at baseline to 33.64% at the 3rd follow-up visit (p < 0.01). Moreover, a significant decline in mean HbA1c and FPG levels was observed from baseline to 3rd follow-up visit (p < 0.01). Minor adverse events were observed, including abdominal discomfort, nausea, flatulence, and indigestion. Gender, HbA1c, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort were significant predictors of a patient's QoL, as revealed by the Linear Regression Model (R2 = 0.265, F(16, 99) = 2.231). Treviamet® & Treviamet XR® significantly improved glycemic control (HbA1c levels) and QoL in T2DM patients without serious adverse events.

Disease awareness and healthcare utilization in rural South Africa: a comparative analysis of HIV and diabetes in the HAALSI cohort.,"Studies from rural South Africa indicate that people living with HIV (PLHIV) may have better health outcomes than those without, potentially due to the frequent healthcare visits necessitated by infection. Here, we examined the association between HIV status and healthcare utilization, using diabetes as an illustrative comparator of another high-burden, healthcare-intensive disease. Our exposure of interest was awareness of positive disease status for both HIV and diabetes. We identified 742 individuals who were HIV-positive and aware of their status and 305 who had diabetes and were aware of their status. HIV-positive status was further grouped by viral suppression. For each disease, we estimated the association with (1) other comorbid, chronic conditions, (2) health facility visits, (3) household-level healthcare expenditure, and (4) per-visit healthcare expenditure. We used log-binomial regression models to estimate prevalence ratios for co-morbid chronic conditions. Linear regression models were used for all other outcomes. Virally suppressed PLHIV had decreased prevalence of chronic conditions, increased public clinic visits [β = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.5, 0.7], and reduced per-visit private clinic spending [β = -60, 95% CI: -83, -6] compared to those without HIV. No differences were observed in hospitalizations and per-visit spending at hospitals and public clinics between virally suppressed PLHIV and non-PLHIV. Conversely, diabetic individuals had increased prevalence of chronic conditions, increased visits across facility types, increased household-level expenditures (β = 88 R, 95% CI: 29, 154), per-visit hospital spending (β = 54 R, 95% CI: 7, 155), and per-visit public clinic spending (β = 31 R, 95% CI: 2, 74) compared to those without diabetes. Our results suggest that older adult PLHIV may visit public clinics more often than their HIV-negative counterparts but spend similarly on a per-visit basis. This provides preliminary evidence that the positive health outcomes observed among PLHIV in rural South Africa may be explained by different healthcare engagement patterns. Through our illustrative comparison between PLHIV and diabetics, we show that shifting disease burdens towards chronic and historically underfunded diseases, like diabetes, may be changing the landscape of health expenditure inequities.",D006801:Humans;D000368:Aged;D015658:HIV Infections;D013019:South Africa;D003695:Delivery of Health Care;D010342:Patient Acceptance of Health Care;D003920:Diabetes Mellitus;D002908:Chronic Disease,diabetes
Plasma ceramides are associated with MRI-based liver fat content but not with noninvasive scores of liver fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"There is growing evidence that ceramides play a significant role in the onset and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a highly prevalent condition in patients with type 2 diabetes associated with hepatic and cardiovascular events. However, the relationship between plasma ceramide levels and NAFLD severity in type 2 diabetes remains unclear. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate whether circulating levels of ceramides in patients with type 2 diabetes are associated with liver steatosis assessed by the highly accurate magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). The secondary objective was to assess the relationship between plasma ceramides and noninvasive scores of liver fibrosis. In this cross-sectional single-center study, plasma concentrations of 7 ceramides were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 255 patients with type 2 diabetes (GEPSAD cohort). Liver fat content was assessed by MRI-PDFF, and noninvasive scores of liver fibrosis (i.e. Fibrosis-4 index, NAFLD Fibrosis Score, FibroTest® and Fibrotic NASH Index) were calculated. A validation cohort of 80 patients with type 2 diabetes was also studied (LIRA-NAFLD cohort). Liver steatosis, defined as a liver fat content > 5.56%, was found in 62.4 and 82.5% of individuals with type 2 diabetes in the GEPSAD and LIRA-NAFLD cohorts, respectively. In GEPSAD, MRI-PDFF-measured liver fat content was positively associated with plasma levels of total ceramides (r = 0.232, p = 0.0002), and 18:0, 20:0, 22:0 and 24:0 ceramides in univariate analysis (p ≤ 0.0003 for all). In multivariate analysis, liver fat content remained significantly associated with total ceramides (p = 0.001), 18:0 (p = 0.006), 22:0 (p = 0.0009) and 24:0 ceramides (p = 0.0001) in GEPSAD, independently of age, diabetes duration, body mass index and dyslipidemia. Overall, similar relationship between plasma ceramides and liver fat content was observed in the LIRA-NAFLD validation cohort. No significant association was found between plasma ceramides and noninvasive scores of fibrosis after adjustment for age in both cohorts. Plasma ceramide levels are associated with liver steatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes, independently of traditional risk factors for NAFLD. The independent association between plasma ceramides and liver steatosis adds new insights regarding the relationship between ceramides and NAFLD in type 2 diabetes.","D006801:Humans;D065626:Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D002518:Ceramides;D008099:Liver;D008103:Liver Cirrhosis;D008279:Magnetic Resonance Imaging",diabetes
"Treatment-seeking behaviour among 15-49-year-olds with self-reported heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes: a national cross-sectional study in India.","Eighty per cent of India´s non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality is due to four conditions: heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes, which are primarily cause-amenable through treatment. Based on Andersen's behavioural model of health services use, the current study aimed to identify the predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with treatment-seeking status among people self-reporting the four main NCDs in India. Cross-sectional study using secondary data. Usual residents aged 15-49 who self-reported cancer (n = 1 056), chronic respiratory disease (n = 10 534), diabetes (n = 13 501), and/or heart disease (n = 5 861) during the fifth National Family and Health Survey (NFHS-5), 2019-21, were included. Treatment-seeking status was modelled separately for each disease using survey-adjusted multivariable logistic regression. 3.9% of India´s 15-49-year-old population self-reported ≥ 1 of the four main NCDs (0.1% cancer, 1.4% chronic respiratory disease, 2% diabetes, 0.8% heart disease). The percentage that had sought treatment for their condition(s) was 82%, 68%, 76%, and 74%, respectively. Greater age and having ≥ 1 of the NCDs were associated with greater odds of seeking disease-specific treatment. People in the middle or lower wealth quintiles had lower odds of seeking care than the wealthiest 20% for all conditions. Women with diabetes or chronic respiratory disease had greater odds of seeking disease-specific treatment than men. Muslims, the unmarried, and those with health insurance had greater odds of seeking cancer treatment than Hindus, the married, and the uninsured. Predisposing, enabling, and need factors are associated with treatment-seeking status among people reporting the four major NCDs in India, suggesting that multiple processes inform the decision to seek disease-specific care among aware cases. Successfully encouraging and enabling as many people as possible who knowingly live with major NCDs to seek treatment is likely contingent on a multi-pronged approach to healthcare policy-making. The need to improve treatment uptake through accessible healthcare is further underscored by the fact that one-fifth (cancer) to one-third (chronic respiratory disease) of 15-49-year-olds reporting a major NCD have never sought treatment despite being aware of their condition.",D008297:Male;D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D000293:Adolescent;D055815:Young Adult;D000328:Adult;D008875:Middle Aged;D057566:Self Report;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D000073296:Noncommunicable Diseases;D006331:Heart Diseases;D003920:Diabetes Mellitus;D011795:Surveys and Questionnaires;D009369:Neoplasms;D012120:Respiration Disorders;D007194:India;D002908:Chronic Disease,diabetes
"Effect of SGLT-2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, on left ventricular remodeling in patients with type 2 diabetes and HFrEF.","The current study evaluated the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, on left ventricular remodeling in patients with type 2 diabetes and HFrEF. 60 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily, or placebo double blind for 1 year. Patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography and doppler evaluation prior to dapagliflozin initiation and at 1 year. At 1year, adjusted mean difference versus placebo in change from baseline in LVEF was 2.5% (95% CI: 1.00-4.06, P = 0.002). Adjusted mean difference versus placebo in change from baseline in LVED volume was - 6.0ml (95% CI: -8.07 --3.87, P<0.001).

Diabetes mellitus and latent tuberculosis infection: an updated meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Previous studies have demonstrated an association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). This study was conducted to update the current understanding of the association between DM and LTBI. By conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) or risk ratios (aRR), we aimed to further explore the association between DM and LTBI and provide essential reference for future research. We conducted comprehensive searches in Embase, Cochrane Library, and PubMed without imposing any start date or language restrictions, up to July 19, 2022. Our study selection encompassed observational research that compared from LTBI positive rates in both DM and non-DM groups and reported aRR or aOR results. The quality of the included studies was assessed utilizing the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using random-effects models, along with their associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 22 studies involving 68,256 subjects. Three cohort studies were eligible, with a pooled aRR of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.71-2.23). Nineteen cross-sectional studies were eligible, with a pooled aOR of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.14-1.29). The crude RR (cRR) pooled estimate for three cohort studies was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.03-2.57). Among the cross-sectional studies we included, sixteen studies provided crude ORs, and the crude OR (cOR) pooled estimate was 1.64 (95% CI: 1.36-1.97). In the diagnosis of diabetes, the pooled aOR of the HbA1c group was higher than that of self-reported group (pooled aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.24-1.96 vs. 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06-1.28). Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest a positive association between DM and LTBI. Individuals with DM may have a higher risk of LTBI compared to those without DM.

Uric acid and evaluate the coronary vascular stenosis gensini score correlation research and in gender differences.,"Recent studies have shown that the negative effect of uric acid (UA) on coronary arteries determines the severity of atherosclerotic disease. This study aims to explore the relationship between serum UA level and Gensini score, which reflects the severity of coronary artery disease. A total of 860 patients with suspected coronary heart disease who were admitted to hospital due to angina pectoris or myocardial ischemia related symptoms and received coronary angiography were selected. Based on the findings of the angiography, they were categorized into two groups: the coronary heart disease (CHD) group (n = 625) and the control group (n = 235). The uric acid levels and other clinical data were compared between these groups. Additionally, the prevalence of coronary heart disease and Gensini score were compared between the groups, considering gender-specific quartiles of uric acid levels. The clinical baseline data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent risk factors for coronary heart disease. Of 860 patients (mean age, 63.97 ± 11.87 years), 528 were men (mean age, 62.06 ± 11.5 years) and 332 were women (mean age, 66.99 ± 10.11 years). The proportion of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in the coronary heart disease group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). HbA1C, Gensini score, BMI, TG and hsCRP in the coronary heart disease group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), and HDL-C was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in age, heart rate, Cr, TC and LDL-C between the two groups (P > 0.05).Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, hypertension, hsCRP and SUA levels increased the risk of coronary heart disease, and the difference was statistically significant(OR = 1.034,95%CI 1.016-1.052, P = 0.001; OR = 1.469,95%CI 1.007-2.142, P = 0.046;OR = 1.064,95%CI 1.026-1.105, P = 0.001; OR = 1.011,95%CI 1.008-1.014, P < 0.001).

Monotherapy Versus Combination Therapy in the Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Painful peripheral neuropathy is a common and challenging complication of diabetes mellitus. Combination therapy is used widely by clinicians, although strong evidence for efficacy and safety is lacking. The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of combination versus monotherapy of first-line medications for peripheral diabetic neuropathy. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched on December 5, 2022, for randomized clinical trials comparing combined therapy with gabapentinoids and either tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) versus monotherapy with any of these drugs. Pooled mean differences (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed for pain outcomes, measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale averaging pain scores in the last 7 days. Risk ratios (RRs) were computed for binary endpoints. Risk assessment was performed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. A total of five randomized studies and 916 patients were included. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 12 weeks. Mean pain reduction was greater for combination therapy than monotherapy (MD - 0.39; 95% CI - 0.67 to - 0.12; p = 0.005). Similarly, there was an improvement in ≥ 30% reduction in average pain (RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.07-1.26; p < 0.01) with combination therapy. In contrast, there was no significant difference between groups in ≥ 50% reduction in average pain (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.99-1.49; p = 0.06). When comparing combination therapy versus gabapentinoid monotherapy, there was also a significant reduction in average pain (MD - 0.61; 95% CI - 0.85 to - 0.37; p < 0.01) with combination therapy. In patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the combination of gabapentinoids with TCAs or SNRIs is associated with a greater reduction in pain as compared with monotherapy, although this difference may not translate into a clinically important difference.",,diabetes
Early postoperative hyperglycemia as a predictor of postoperative infectious complications and overall survival in non-diabetic patients with esophageal cancer.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known to be a risk factor for postoperative infectious complications (PICs). However, the significance of postoperative hyperglycemia in non-DM cases has not been well investigated. We sought to establish whether postoperative hyperglycemia is associated with PICs and survival among patients with esophageal cancer, with a focus on non-DM cases. A total of 430 patients who underwent subtotal esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 2014 and 2018 were enrolled. Postoperative blood glucose was measured by arterial blood gas test every 8 h from postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD4. The association between hyperglycemia (mean ≥ 200 mg/dl) and PICs or long-term outcomes on each POD was investigated. There were 53 DM and 377 non-DM cases. PICs occurred in 127 patients. In the multivariate analysis of all cases, PICs were associated with hyperglycemia on POD1 or -2 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.05-2.73, P = 0.031 for POD1; OR = 2.55, 95% CI, 1.10-5.93, P = 0.029 for POD 2). Among non-DM cases, the association was more evident, and persisted until POD4 (OR = 1.94, 95% CI, 1.16-3.24, P = 0.012 for POD1; OR = 3.68, 95% CI, 1.28-10.6, P = 0.016 for POD2; OR = 3.07, 95% CI, 1.11-8.51, P = 0.031 for POD4). Survival analyses limited to R0 cases revealed hyperglycemia on POD2 as an independent prognostic factor in all cases (N = 412) [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.61, 95%CI, 1.21-5.63, P = 0.014], with the prognostic impact more evident among non-DM cases (N = 360) (HR = 4.38, 95% CI, 1.82-10.57, P = 0.0010). Postoperative hyperglycemia is associated with PICs and worse survival after esophagectomy, particularly in patients without DM.",Adverse events;Complication;Esophageal cancer;Esophagectomy;Postoperative hyperglycemia,diabetes
Exome sequencing (ES) of a pediatric cohort with chronic endocrine diseases: a single-center study (within the framework of the TRANSLATE-NAMSE project).,"Endocrine disorders are heterogeneous and include a significant number of rare monogenic diseases. We performed exome sequencing (ES) in 106 children recruited from a single center within the TRANSLATE‑NAMSE project. They were categorized into subgroups: proportionate short stature (PSS), disproportionate short stature (DSS), hypopituitarism (H), differences in sexual development (DSD), syndromic diseases (SD) and others. The overall diagnostic yield was 34.9% (n = 37/106), including 5 patients with variants in candidate genes, which have contributed to collaborations to identify gene-disease associations. The diagnostic yield varied significantly between subgroups: PSS: 16.6% (1/6); DSS: 18.8% (3/16); H: 17.1% (6/35); DSD: 37.5% (3/8); SD: 66.6% (22/33); others: 25% (2/8). Confirmed diagnoses included 75% ultrarare diseases. Three patients harbored more than one disease-causing variant, resulting in dual diagnoses. ES is an effective tool for genetic diagnosis in pediatric patients with complex endocrine diseases. An accurate phenotypic description, including comprehensive endocrine diagnostics, as well as the evaluation of variants in multidisciplinary case conferences involving geneticists, are necessary for personalized diagnostic care. Here, we illustrate the broad spectrum of genetic endocrinopathies that have led to the initiation of specific treatment, surveillance, and family counseling.",Exome sequencing;TRANSLATE-NAMSE;chronic pediatric endocrine diseases;multidisciplinary case conferences;rare diseases,diabetes
A National Survey of Physicians' Views on the Importance and Implementation of Deintensifying Diabetes Medications.,"Guidelines recommend deintensifying hypoglycemia-causing medications for older adults with diabetes whose hemoglobin A1c is below their individualized target, but this rarely occurs in practice. To understand physicians' decision-making around deintensifying diabetes treatment. National physician survey. US physicians in general medicine, geriatrics, or endocrinology providing outpatient diabetes care. Physicians rated the importance of deintensifying diabetes medications for older adults with type 2 diabetes, and of switching medication classes, on 5-point Likert scales. They reported the frequency of these actions for their patients, and listed important barriers and facilitators. We evaluated the independent association between physicians' professional and practice characteristics and the importance of deintensifying and switching diabetes medications using multivariable ordered logistic regression models. There were 445 eligible respondents (response rate 37.5%). The majority of physicians viewed deintensifying (80%) and switching (92%) diabetes medications as important or very important to the care of older adults. Despite this, one-third of physicians reported deintensifying diabetes medications rarely or never. While most physicians recognized multiple reasons to deintensify, two-thirds of physicians reported barriers of short-term hyperglycemia and patient reluctance to change medications or allow higher glucose levels. In multivariable models, geriatricians rated deintensification as more important compared to other specialties (p=0.027), and endocrinologists rated switching as more important compared to other specialties (p<0.006). Physicians with fewer years in practice rated higher importance of deintensification (p<0.001) and switching (p=0.003). While most US physicians viewed deintensifying and switching diabetes medications as important for the care of older adults, they deintensified infrequently. Physicians had ambivalence about the relative benefits and harms of deintensification and viewed it as a potential source of conflict with their patients. These factors likely contribute to clinical inertia, and studies focused on improving shared decision-making around deintensifying diabetes medications are needed.","aging;deprescriptions;diabetes mellitus, type 2;drug-related side effects and adverse reactions;hypoglycemia",diabetes
Impact of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) on Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery.,"Obesity and associated comorbidities, such as NAFLD, impose a major healthcare burden worldwide. Bariatric surgery remains the most successful approach for sustained weight loss and the resolution of obesity-related complications. However, the impact of preexisting NAFLD on weight loss after bariatric surgery has not been previously studied. The goal of this study is to assess the impact of preexisting NAFLD on weight loss outcomes up to 5 years after weight loss surgery. Data from the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Cohort (MI-BASiC) was extracted to examine the effect of baseline NAFLD on weight loss outcomes. The cohort included a total of 714 patients older than 18 years of age undergoing gastric bypass (GB; 380 patients) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG; 334 patients) at the University of Michigan between January 2008 and November 2013. Repeated measure analysis was used to determine if preexisting NAFLD was a predictor of weight loss outcomes up to 5 years post-surgery. We identified 221 patients with an established clinical diagnosis of NAFLD at baseline. Multivariable repeated measure analysis with adjustment for covariates shows that patients with preexisting NAFLD had a significantly lower percentage of total and excess weight loss compared to patients without preexisting NAFLD. Furthermore, our data show that baseline dyslipidemia is an indicator of the persistence of NAFLD after bariatric surgery. Our data show that patients' body weight loss in response to bariatric surgery is impacted by factors such as preexisting NAFLD. Additionally, we show that NAFLD may persist or recur in a subset of patients after surgery, and thus careful continued follow-up is recommended.",Bariatric surgery;Dyslipidemia;Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease;Persistence;Weight loss,diabetes
Role of cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca,"Pancreatic beta cells utilize Ca2+ to secrete insulin in response to glucose. The glucose-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]C) activates a series of insulin secretory machinery in pancreatic beta cells. Therefore, the amount of insulin secreted in response to glucose is determined in a [Ca2+]C-dependent manner, at least within a moderate range. However, the demand for insulin secretion may surpass the capability of beta cells. Abnormal elevation of [Ca2+]C levels beyond the beta-cell endurance capacity can damage them by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death programs such as apoptosis. Therefore, while Ca2+ is essential for the insulin secretory functions of beta cells, it could affect their survival at pathologically higher levels. Because an increase in beta-cell [Ca2+]C is inevitable under certain hazardous conditions, understanding the regulatory mechanism for [Ca2+]C is important. Therefore, this review discusses beta-cell function, survival, ER stress, and apoptosis associated with intracellular and ER Ca2+ homeostasis.",Apoptosis;Beta cell;Cytosolic Ca2+;Diabetes;ER stress;Store-operated Ca2+ entry,diabetes
Beneficial glycaemic effects of high-amylose barley bread compared to wheat bread in type 2 diabetes.,"Cereals foods with a high content of dietary fibres or amylose have potential to lower postprandial glucose levels. Optimisation of cereal foods may improve management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We investigated the impact on 4 h postprandial glucose responses given as incremental area under curve (iAUC) of bread made of either 50% RNAi-based (genetically modified) amylose-only barley flour (AmOn) (and 50% wheat flour), 50% hulless barley flour (and 50% wheat flour) or 75% hulless barley (and 25% wheat flour) in subjects with T2D compared with 100% wheat flour bread. Twenty adults with T2D were randomly allocated to one of four breads at four separate visits. We measured fasting and 4 h postprandial responses of glucose, insulin, glucagon, triacylglycerol (TG), free fatty acids (FFA), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). Mixed model ANOVA was used to examine the differences. Bread made from 50% AmOn lowered the 4 h postprandial glucose by 34%, 27%, 23% (P < 0.05) compared with 100% wheat, 50% or 75% hulless barley, respectively. Bread made from 75% hulless barley reduced the postprandial glucose response (iAUC) by 11% (P < 0.05) compared to 100% wheat bread. Postprandial insulin responses (iAUC) were reduced for 50% AmOn compared with 100% wheat and 50% hulless barley and for 75% hulless compared to 50% hulless barley bread (P < 0.05). 4 h postprandial glucagon (tAUC) did not differ between the four bread types (P > 0.05). Lower postprandial GIP (iAUC) was observed after all barley breads compared to 100% wheat (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was seen in postprandial GLP-1. Postprandial TG and FFA (tAUC) were difficult to judge due to differences in fasting values. Bread made by replacing wheat flour with either 50% high-amylose or 75% hulless barley flour lowered postprandial glucose responses compared to 100% wheat bread indicating a beneficial impact on glucose regulation in T2D subjects.

A standardized metric to enhance clinical trial design and outcome interpretation in type 1 diabetes.,"The use of a standardized outcome metric enhances clinical trial interpretation and cross-trial comparison. If a disease course is predictable, comparing modeled predictions with outcome data affords the precision and confidence needed to accelerate precision medicine. We demonstrate this approach in type 1 diabetes (T1D) trials aiming to preserve endogenous insulin secretion measured by C-peptide. C-peptide is predictable given an individual's age and baseline value; quantitative response (QR) adjusts for these variables and represents the difference between the observed and predicted outcome. Validated across 13 trials, the QR metric reduces each trial's variance and increases statistical power. As smaller studies are especially subject to random sampling variability, using QR as the outcome introduces alternative interpretations of previous clinical trial results. QR can provide model-based estimates that quantify whether individuals or groups did better or worse than expected. QR also provides a purer metric to associate with biomarker measurements. Using data from more than 1300 participants, we demonstrate the value of QR in advancing disease-modifying therapy in T1D. QR applies to any disease where outcome is predictable by pre-specified baseline covariates, rendering it useful for defining responders to therapy, comparing therapeutic efficacy, and understanding causal pathways in disease.","D006801:Humans;D003922:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;D002096:C-Peptide;D002986:Clinical Trials as Topic;D000078790:Insulin Secretion;D057285:Precision Medicine",diabetes
COVID-19 induced type 1 diabetes: A systematic review of case reports and series.,"To provide an overview of reported cases of new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) following COVID-19 infection. PubMed and Scopus library databases were screened for relevant case reports published between January 2020 and June 2022. Study design, geographic region or language were not restricted. Twenty studies were identified and involved 37 patients (20 [54%] male, 17 [46%] female). Median age was 11.5 years (range 8 months-33 years) and 31 (84%) patients were aged ≤17 years. Most patients (33, 89%) presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In total, 23 (62%) patients presented at the time of positive COVID-19 testing and 14 (38%) had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection or a previous positive test (1-56 days). Diabetes symptomatology was provided in 22 cases and (19, 86%) reported polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue, or weight loss or a combination of the aforementioned in the preceding weeks (3 days-12 weeks). Of the 28 patients that had data on acute and long-term treatment, all recovered well and most were managed with basal bolus insulin regimens. Quality assessment showed that most reports were either 'good' or 'moderate quality'. Although uncommon, new-onset T1D is a condition healthcare professionals may expect to see following a COVID-19 infection.","D006801:Humans;D008297:Male;D005260:Female;D007223:Infant;D003922:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;D000086742:COVID-19 Testing;D000086382:COVID-19;D011141:Polyuria;D016883:Diabetic Ketoacidosis",diabetes
Clinical characteristics and potential biomarkers of thyroid and pituitary immune-related adverse events.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in several organs including endocrine glands. Among endocrine irAEs, thyroid and pituitary irAEs are frequently observed, followed by primary adrenal insufficiency, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and hypoparathyroidism. These conditions could lead to life-threatening consequences, such as adrenal crisis and diabetic ketoacidosis. On the other hand, several types of irAEs including thyroid and pituitary irAEs are reported to be associated with better overall survival. Therefore, it is important to understand and manage endocrine irAEs, which differ depending on the ICI regimen used. In this review, we describe the clinical features, potential biomarkers, management strategies, and possible mechanisms of thyroid and pituitary irAEs.",Biomarkers;Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs);Immune-related adverse events (irAEs);Pituitary;Thyroid,diabetes
Brown fat thermogenesis and branched-chain amino acids in metabolic disease.,"Since the 1960s, researchers have recognized an association between elevated plasma branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, but the cause for it remained poorly understood. Recent advances in metabolomics, advanced imaging techniques, and genetic analyses over the past decade have enabled newfound insights into the mechanism of BCAA metabolic dysregulation across a variety of peripheral tissues and its impact on metabolic disease, suggesting a key role for brown adipose tissue (BAT) in determining BCAA metabolic homeostasis. Previous investigations into BAT have emphasized fatty acids and glucose as substrates for BAT thermogenesis. Here, we address the importance of BAT in systemic BCAA metabolism, driven via the newly identified mitochondrial BCAA carrier (MBC), as well as the impact of BAT-driven BCAA clearance on glucose homeostasis and metabolic disease. The newly identified MBC offers new therapeutic avenues by which BAT activity may be enhanced to improve metabolic and cardiovascular health, as well as other diseases in which increases of circulating BCAA may play a role in pathogenicity.",Beige adipocytes;Branched-chain amino acids;Brown adipose tissue;Diabetes;Transporter,diabetes
Molecular composition of adiponectin in urine is a useful biomarker for detecting early stage of diabetic kidney disease.,"We previously developed two immune complex transfer enzyme immunoassays (ICT-EIA) to measure total adiponectin (T-AN) and high molecular weight adiponectin (H-AN) in urine and have verified their usefulness as biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease. In this study, we developed T-AN and H-AN assays using the sandwich EIA (Sand-EIA). The reactivities of Sand-EIAs were compared with ICT-EIAs by measuring size exclusion chromatography (SEC) fractions of urine and adiponectin standard. As a result, ICT-EIAs showed higher macromolecular specificity. We then analyzed the molecular profile of adiponectin in the urine of 5 patients with different eGFR stages by measuring SEC fractions of urine. The results showed that smaller adiponectin correlated relatively well with eGFR stage. Finally, because SEC is time-consuming, we investigated that the ratio of T-ANs by Sand-EIA and ICT-EIA could be a good indicator of the monomer adiponectin. The ratio was evaluated using 77 urine samples from patients with diabetes and showed a significant decrease at an earlier stage compared with other biomarkers. In conclusion, we demonstrated a new index to estimate monomer adiponectin in urine by using Sand-EIA and ICT-EIA, and urinary monomer adiponectin can be a good early indicator of deterioration of renal function in diabetic patients.

Post-meal endogenous insulin secretion was significantly lower in head than in body/tail cancer of the pancreas.,"Pancreatic cancer, a rapidly progressive malignancy, is often diagnosed in patients with diabetes. The incidence of pancreatic cancer has risen dramatically over recent decades. Early diagnosis of this malignancy is generally difficult because the symptoms do not become apparent until the disease has progressed, generally leading to a poor outcome. To achieve earlier diagnosis, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of pancreatic cancer patients showing deterioration of plasma glucose levels while hospitalized. Thirty-six cases were divided into 2 groups;those diagnosed with diabetes more than a year prior to identification of pancreatic cancer and diabetes secondary to pancreatic cancer. These 2 groups were further subdivided according to the tumor site (head or body/tail), allowing analysis of 4 subgroups. Anthropometric measurements, laboratory values were determined. Both groups with diabetes lost at least 4 kg and showed HbA1c deterioration of at least 1% within 5 months of the pancreatic cancer diagnosis. The post-meal elevation of serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) was significantly decreased in the group with cancer of the pancreatic head, and this was unrelated to tumor size. Characteristically, pancreatic head cancer was associated with decreased endogenous insulin secretion as compared to body/tail cancer. J. Med.

Peripheral Artery Disease: Underappreciated Impact and Residual Cardiovascular Risk Despite Revascularization.,"This Commentary highlights the under-recognized prevalence and heavy burden of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and its important role as a harbinger of complications of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although increasing in prevalence globally, PAD is being further accelerated with diabetes, and patients with advanced PAD are at high risk for chronic limb-threatening ischemia. The need for (repeated) revascularization and amputation places a heavy social burden on patients and family, and a heavy financial burden on the health care system, exceeding the cost of coronary artery and cerebrovascular diseases. Clinical trial research in PAD will be enhanced by widely agreed-upon definitions of major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events. Antithrombotic and lipid-lowering therapies are recommended but underutilized, while the optimal peri-interventional antithrombotic regimen is still under debate. Additional antiinflammatory treatment is currently an unaddressed strategy in the management of patients with PAD, and there is a strong case for the evaluation of widely available antiinflammatory agents such as colchicine.",Atherosclerosis;CLTI;Chronic limb-threatening ischemia;Inflammation;PAD;Peripheral arterial disease,diabetes
Head-to-head trial of pegunigalsidase alfa versus agalsidase beta in patients with Fabry disease and deteriorating renal function: results from the 2-year randomised phase III BALANCE study.,"Pegunigalsidase alfa is a PEGylated α-galactosidase A enzyme replacement therapy. BALANCE (NCT02795676) assessed non-inferiority of pegunigalsidase alfa versus agalsidase beta in adults with Fabry disease with an annualised estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope more negative than -2 mL/min/1.73 m2/year who had received agalsidase beta for ≥1 year. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta every 2 weeks for 2 years. The primary efficacy analysis assessed non-inferiority based on median annualised eGFR slope differences between treatment arms. Seventy-seven patients received either pegunigalsidase alfa (n=52) or agalsidase beta (n=25). At baseline, mean (range) age was 44 (18-60) years, 47 (61%) patients were male, median eGFR was 74.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 and median (range) eGFR slope was -7.3 (-30.5, 6.3) mL/min/1.73 m2/year. At 2 years, the difference between median eGFR slopes was -0.36 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, meeting the prespecified non-inferiority margin. Minimal changes were observed in lyso-Gb3 concentrations in both treatment arms at 2 years. Proportions of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions were similar in both groups, yet exposure-adjusted rates were 3.6-fold and 7.8-fold higher, respectively, with agalsidase beta than pegunigalsidase alfa. At the end of the study, neutralising antibodies were detected in 7 out of 47 (15%) pegunigalsidase alfa-treated patients and 6 out of 23 (26%) agalsidase beta-treated patients. There were no deaths. Based on rate of eGFR decline over 2 years, pegunigalsidase alfa was non-inferior to agalsidase beta. Pegunigalsidase alfa had lower rates of treatment-emergent adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions.

Weight change in patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus and its association with remission: Comprehensive real-world data.,"We aimed to investigate weight change in patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus and the association of weight loss on diabetes remission in Korean adults. We used the health examination database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service. Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2009 to 2012 were enrolled and followed to 2017. The baseline body weight was measured at the health examination closest to the time the patient was enrolled, and the change was calculated by examining the weight measured at the subsequent examination within 2 years. Remission was defined as fasting blood glucose less than 126 mg/dl at two or more consecutive health examinations after stopping medication. In total, 114, 874 patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus were analysed. Of these, 23 156 (20.2%) lost more than 5% of their body weight, and 2429 (2.1%) achieved remission. The adjusted odds ratio for remission in the weight loss group was 2.56 (95% confidence interval 2.35-2.79) compared with the group with stable body weight. Sensitivity analysis according to the degree of weight change showed that the greater weight loss, the higher the likelihood of remission. In the subgroup analysis, the effects of weight loss on remission were significantly greater in subgroups of age <65 years, male sex and body mass index >25. Weight loss within the first 2 years of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with diabetes remission. Physicians should pay more attention to weight management in new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly for young and obese individuals.",obesity;type 2 diabetes;weight change,diabetes
Engineering superstable islets-laden chitosan microgels with carboxymethyl cellulose coating for long-term blood glucose regulation in vivo.,"Islet transplantation to restore endogenous insulin secretion is a promising therapy for type 1 diabetes in clinic. However, host immune rejection seriously limits the survival of transplanted islets. Despite of the various encapsulation strategies and materials developed so far to provide immune isolation for transplanted islets, long-term blood glucose regulation is still difficult due to the inherent defects of the encapsulation materials. Herein, a novel islet-encapsulation composite material with low immunogenicity, good biocompatibility and excellent stability is reported. Specifically, chitosan (CS) microgels (diameter: ∼302 μm) are prepared via Michael addition reaction between maleimide grafted chitosan (CS-Mal) and thiol grafted chitosan (CS-NAC) in droplet-based microfluidic device, and then zwitterionic surface layer is constructed on CS microgel surface by covalent binding between maleimide groups on CS and thiol groups on thiol modified carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-SH). The as-formed carboxymethyl cellulose coated chitosan (CS@CMC) microgels show not only long-term stability in vivo owing to the non-biodegradability of CMC, but also fantastic anti-adsorption and antifibrosis because of the stable zwitterionic surface layer. As a result, islets encapsulated in the CS@CMC microgels exhibit high viability and good insulin secretion function in vivo, and long-term blood glucose regulation is achieved for 180 days in diabetic mice post-transplantation.","D051379:Mice;D000818:Animals;D001786:Blood Glucose;D000080386:Microgels;D048271:Chitosan;D002266:Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium;D003921:Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental;D008301:Maleimides;D013438:Sulfhydryl Compounds;D007515:Islets of Langerhans",diabetes
Materials and structure of polysaccharide-based delivery carriers for oral insulin: A review.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease that affects >500 million patients worldwide. Subcutaneous injection of insulin is the most effective treatment at present. However, regular needle injections will cause pain, inflammation, and other adverse consequences. In recent years, significant progress has been made in non-injectable insulin preparations. Oral administration is the best way of administration due to its simplicity, convenience, and good patient compliance. However, oral insulin delivery is hindered by many physiological barriers in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the low relative bioavailability of direct oral insulin delivery. To improve the relative bioavailability, a variety of insulin delivery vectors have been developed. Polysaccharides are used to achieve safe and effective insulin loading due to their excellent biocompatibility and protein affinity. The functional characteristics of polysaccharide-based delivery carriers, such as pH responsiveness, mucosal adhesion, and further functionalization modifications, enhance the gastrointestinal absorption and bioavailability of insulin. This paper reviews the materials and structures of oral insulin polysaccharide-based carriers, providing ideas for further improving the relative bioavailability of oral insulin.","D006801:Humans;D007328:Insulin;D016503:Drug Delivery Systems;D004337:Drug Carriers;D003920:Diabetes Mellitus;D011134:Polysaccharides;D000284:Administration, Oral;D053758:Nanoparticles",diabetes

Promoting REproductive Planning And REadiness in Diabetes (PREPARED) Study protocol: a clinic-randomised controlled trial testing a technology-based strategy to promote preconception care for women with type 2 diabetes.,"Women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are more likely to experience adverse reproductive outcomes, yet preconception care can significantly reduce these risks. For women with T2DM, preconception care includes reproductive planning and patient education on: (1) the importance of achieving glycaemic control before pregnancy, (2) using effective contraception until pregnancy is desired, (3) discontinuing teratogenic medications if pregnancy could occur, (4) taking folic acid, and (5) managing cardiovascular and other risks. Despite its importance, few women with T2DM receive recommended preconception care. We are conducting a two-arm, clinic-randomised trial at 51 primary care practices in Chicago, Illinois to evaluate a technology-based strategy to 'hardwire' preconception care for women of reproductive age with T2DM (the PREPARED (Promoting REproductive Planning And REadiness in Diabetes) strategy) versus usual care. PREPARED leverages electronic health record (EHR) technology before and during primary care visits to: (1) promote medication safety, (2) prompt preconception counselling and reproductive planning, and (3) deliver patient-friendly educational tools to reinforce counselling. Post-visit, text messaging is used to: (4) encourage healthy lifestyle behaviours. English and Spanish-speaking women, aged 18-44 years, with T2DM will be enrolled (N=840; n=420 per arm) and will receive either PREPARED or usual care based on their clinic's assignment. Data will be collected from patient interviews and the EHR. Outcomes include haemoglobin A1c (primary), reproductive knowledge and self-management behaviours. We will use generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to evaluate the impact of PREPARED on these outcomes. GLMMs will include a fixed effect for treatment assignment (PREPARED vs usual care) and random clinic effects. This study was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board (STU00214604).

However, many details in these aspects have not been systematically reviewed. This review firstly described the influence of preoperative assessment, especially for the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM), as well as the molecular testing on the selection of TA for PTMC. Besides, we also summarized the experiences in treating special PTMC cases by TA, like multifocal lesions, PTMC located in the isthmus or adjacent to the dorsal capsule. At last, we discussed the follow-up strategies, the influence of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level on the prognosis of PTMCs, and the management for recurrent cases. In conclusion, the procedures during the entire perioperative period should be standardized to improve the outcomes of TA in treating PTMC patients.","D006801:Humans;D013964:Thyroid Neoplasms;D002291:Carcinoma, Papillary;D011379:Prognosis;D018084:Ultrasonography, Interventional;D012189:Retrospective Studies",diabetes
Age-related difference in acute type B aortic dissection.,"The objective is to compare the characteristics of clinical data, imaging data, and treatment methods of young and old patients with acute type B aortic dissection (ABAD).

Old ABAD patients were more likely to have a prior history of hypertension (88.6% vs 70.4%, p = 0.037) and atherosclerosis (29.8% vs 7.4%, p = 0.016). In the young group, Marfan syndrome was significantly higher (14.8% vs 0.9%; p = 0.005). Compared with the old group, the number of distal tears in the young group was significantly higher (62.3% vs 39.5%, p = 0.027). The proportion of patients with malperfusion of lower limbs in the young group was significantly higher than that in the old group (22.2% vs 6.1%, p = 0.026). There was no significant difference in the treatment methods and in-hospital mortality between the two groups. Compared with old ABAD patients, young ABAD patients had more distal tears and a higher proportion of lower limbs malperfusion.",Acute type B aortic dissection;Marfan syndrome;age;treatment,diabetes
"Gestational diabetes mellitus and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in young offspring, does the risk differ by race and ethnicity?","Previous studies examined the associations of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the associations between GDM and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as the common speech/language disorder (SLD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD), are rarely studied and whether the associations vary by race/ethnicity remains unknown. To examine the associations of GDM with individual NDDs in young offspring and investigate whether the associations varied by race/ethnicity. This retrospective cohort study (Glucose in Relation to Women and Babies' Health [GrownB]) included 14,480 mother-offspring pairs in a large medical center in the United States (US) from 3/1/2013 to 8/31/2021. We ascertained GDM using the validated International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes (ICD-9: 648.8x; ICD-10: O24.4x), and identified NDDs (SLD, DCD, ASD, and other NDDs [ADHD, behavioral disorder, intellectual disability, and learning difficulty]) and their combinations using validated algorithms. We compared the hazard of NDDs during the entire follow-up period between offspring born to mothers with and without GDM using multivariable Cox regression models. Among all mothers, 19.9% were Asians, 21.8% were Hispanics, 41.0% were non-Hispanic Whites, and 17.3% were other/unknown race/ethnicity. During the median follow-up of 3.5 years (range: 1.0-6.3 years) after birth, 8.7% of offspring developed at least one NDD. GDM was associated with a higher risk of SLD (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.59 [95% confidence interval, 1.07, 2.35]), DCD (2.36 [1.37, 4.04]), ASD (3.16 [1.36, 7.37]), other NDDs (3.12 [1.51, 6.47]), any NDD (1.86 [1.36, 2.53]), combination of SLD and ASD (3.79 [1.35, 10.61]), and combination of SLD and DCD (4.22 [1.69, 10.51]) among offspring born to non-Hispanic White mothers. No associations between GDM and any NDDs or their combinations were observed among offspring born to mothers of other racial/ethnic groups. We observed an elevated risk of NDDs in young offspring born to non-Hispanic White mothers with GDM, but not among other racial/ethnic groups.",gestational diabetes mellitus;neurodevelopmental disorder;pregnancy,diabetes
Endothelial heterogeneity and their relevance in cardiac development and coronary artery disease.,"Micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells (ECs) are characterized by structural and functional heterogeneity, which is also reflected in their secretory activity. The root of this heterogeneity and related regulatory mechanisms are still poorly understood. During embryogenesis, microvascular ECs participate in organogenesis prior to the development of the fetal circulation, suggesting that ECs are capable of releasing paracrine trophogens, termed angiocrine factors (AFs). These are angiocrine growth factors, adhesion molecules, and chemokines, which are intended to promote morphogenesis and repair of the adjacent parenchyma/stroma where the vessels are located. There is a tissue and organ-specificity of AFs that traces the heterogeneity of ECs. This AF heterogeneity also traces how ECs respond to pathological conditions or exposure to cardiovascular risk factors. The study of the mechanisms that regulate endothelial and paracrine heterogeneity and that contribute to endotheliopathy represents a broad and as yet understudied area of research. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate this heterogeneity, leading to endotheliopathy is an exciting challenge. In this brief review we will discuss experimental advances in the heterogeneity of ECs and their AF, with a focus on their involvement in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease.",Angiocrine factors;Atherosclerosis;Cardiac development diabetes;Endothelial cells;Heterogeneity,diabetes
Impact of fasting & ketogenic interventions on the NLRP3 inflammasome: A narrative review.,"Overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in chronic low-grade inflammation associated with various disease states, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Emerging evidence, mostly from cell and animal models of disease, supports a role for ketosis in general, and the main circulating ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in particular, in reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation to ameliorate chronic inflammation. As a result, interventions that can induce ketosis (e.g., fasting, intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding/eating, very low-carbohydrate high-fat ketogenic diets) and/or increase circulating BHB (e.g., exogenous ketone supplementation) have garnered increasing interest for their therapeutic potential. The purpose of the present review is to summarize our current understanding of the literature on how ketogenic interventions impact the NLRP3 inflammasome across human, rodent and cell models. Overall, there is convincing evidence that ketogenic interventions, likely acting through multiple interacting mechanisms in a cell-, disease- and context-specific manner, can reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The evidence supports a direct effect of BHB, although it is important to consider the myriad of other metabolic responses to fasting or ketogenic diet interventions (e.g., elevated lipolysis, low insulin, stable glucose, negative energy balance) that may also impact innate immune responses. Future research is needed to translate promising findings from discovery science to clinical application.",Beta-hydroxybutyrate;Fasting;Inflammation;Ketogenic diets;NLRP3 inflammasome,diabetes
Glucose fluctuations aggravated the late sodium current induced ventricular arrhythmias via the activation of ROS/CaMKII pathway.,"Recent evidence revealed that glucose fluctuation might be more likely to cause arrhythmia than persistent hyperglycemia, whereas its mechanisms were elusive. We aimed to investigate the effect of glucose fluctuation on the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia and its mechanism. Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats were randomized to five groups: the controlled blood glucose (C-STZ) group, uncontrolled blood glucose (U-STZ) group, fluctuated blood glucose (GF-STZ) group, and GF-STZ rats with 100 mg/kg Tempol (GF-STZ + Tempol) group or with 5 mg/kg KN93 (GF-STZ + KN93) group. Six weeks later, the susceptibility of ventricular arrhythmias and the electrophysiological dysfunctions of ventricular myocytes were evaluated using electrocardiogram and patch-clamp technique, respectively. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized CaMKII (ox-CaMKII) were determined by fluorescence assay and Western blot, respectively. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9C2 cells in vitro were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. The induction rate of ventricular arrhythmias was 10%, 55%, and 90% in C-STZ group, U-STZ group, and GF-STZ group, respectively (P < 0.05). The electrophysiological dysfunctions of ventricular myocytes, including action potential duration at repolarization of 90% (APD90), APD90 short-term variability (APD90-STV), late sodium current (INa-L), early after depolarization (EAD) and delayed after depolarizations (DAD), as well as the levels of ROS and ox-CaMKII, were significantly increased in GF-STZ group. In vivo and ex vivo, inhibition of ROS or ox-CaMKII reversed these effects. Inhibition of INa-L also significantly alleviated the electrophysiological dysfunctions. In vitro, inhibition of ROS increase could significantly decrease the ox-CaMKII activation induced by glucose fluctuations. Glucose fluctuations aggravated the INa-L induced ventricular arrhythmias though the activation of ROS/CaMKII pathway.",Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;Diabetes mellitus;Glucose fluctuation;Late sodium current;Reactive oxygen species;Ventricular arrhythmias,diabetes
"Correlation between inflammatory biomarkers, cognitive function and glycemic and lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","This study aimed to quantitatively estimate the correlation between systemic inflammation with cognitive function, as well as glycemic and lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and CBM databases were searched from its inception until June 2023 (PROSPERO registration: CRD42022356889). We analyzed data extracted from observational studies to quantify the correlations (r) as the pooled effect size and further performed subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. A total of 32 studies involving 7,483 patients with T2DM were included. The findings revealed a significant moderate negative correlation between interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. TNF-α levels also had moderate negative correlation with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. For glycemic and lipid profiles, there was a significant moderate positive correlation between CRP and TNF-α levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and TNF-α levels were also found to be lowly positively correlated with fasting blood glucose (FBG). CRP levels were found to have a low positive correlation with total cholesterol (TC), and IL-6 levels were found to be lowly positively correlated with triglycerides. The results indicate that elevated levels of IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α are significantly associated with cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM and may serve as inflammatory markers for T2DM with mild cognitive impairment. The CRP and TNF-α levels were more strongly correlated with HbA1c than with FBG and TC. Further research is needed to determine the clinical value of these inflammatory biomarkers and to investigate potential causal mechanisms underlying this association.",HbA1c;Inflammation;Type 2 diabetes mellitus;meta-analysis;mild cognitive impairment,diabetes
Causal associations between modifiable risk factors and intervertebral disc degeneration.,"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a common degenerative condition, which is thought to be a major cause of lower back pain (LBP). However, the etiology and pathophysiology of IVDD are not yet completely clear. To examine potential causal effects of modifiable risk factors on IVDD. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sample sizes between 54,358 and 766,345 participants. Outcomes included (1) Modifiable risk factors associated with IVDD use in the forward MR; and (2) modifiable risk factors that were determined to have a causal association with IVDD in the reverse MR, including smoking, alcohol intake, standing height, education level, household income, sleeplessness, hypertension, hip osteoarthritis, HDL, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-I, type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, HbA1c, BMI and obesity trait. We obtained genetic variants associated with 33 exposure factors from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics for IVDD were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The risk factors of IVDD were analyzed by inverse variance weighting method, MR-Egger method, weighted median method, MR-PRESSO method and multivariate MR Method. Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was performed on risk factors found to be caustically associated with IVDD in the forward Mendelian randomization analysis. Heterogeneity of instrumental variables was quantified using Cochran's Q statistic. Genetic predisposition to smoking (OR=1.221, 95% CI: 1.068-1.396), alcohol intake (OR=1.208, 95% CI: 1.056-1.328) and standing height (OR=1.149, 95% CI: 1.072-1.231) were associated with increased risk of IVDD. In addition, education level (OR=0.573, 95%CI: 0.502-0.654)and household income (OR=0.614, 95%CI: 0.445-0.847) had a protective effect on IVDD. Sleeplessness (OR=1.799, 95%CI: 1.162-2.783), hypertension (OR=2.113, 95%CI: 1.132-3.944) and type 2 diabetes (OR=1.069, 95%CI: 1.024-1.115) are three important risk factors causally associated with the IVDD. In addition, we demonstrated that increased levels of triglycerides (OR=1.080, 95%CI:1.013-1.151), fasting glucose (OR=1.189, 95%CI:1.007-1.405), and HbA1c (OR=1.308, 95%CI:1.017-1.683) could significantly increase the odds of IVDD. Hip osteoarthritis, HDL, apolipoprotein A-I, BMI and obesity trait factors showed bidirectional causal associations with IVDD, therefore we considered the causal associations between these risk factors and IVDD to be uncertain. This MR study provides evidence of complex causal associations between modifiable risk factors and IVDD. It is noteworthy that metabolic disturbances appear to have a more significant effect on IVDD than biomechanical alterations, as individuals with type 2 diabetes, elevated triglycerides, fasting glucose, and elevated HbA1c are at higher risk for IVDD, and the causal association of obesity-related characteristics with IVDD incidence is unclear. These findings provide new insights into potential therapeutic and prevention strategies. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of these risk factors on IVDD.",Intervertebral disc degeneration;Mendelian randomization;causal association;metabolic disturbances;modifiable risk factors,diabetes
Mulberry leaf multi-components exert hypoglycemic effects through regulation of the PI-3K/Akt insulin signaling pathway in type 2 diabetic rats.,"Phytochemicals have unique advantages in the treatment of diabetes due to their multi-target activity and low toxicity. Mulberry leaves, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, have been used in the prevention and treatment of diabetes for centuries. The main active ingredients in mulberry leaves with regards to the hypoglycemic effect are 1-deoxynojirimycin, flavonoids, and polysaccharides. However, the combined hypoglycemic effects and mechanisms of mulberry leaf multi-components remain unclear. This study explored the anti-diabetic effects of mulberry leaf multi-components (MMC) and the role of the PI-3K/Akt insulin signalling pathway in improving insulin resistance. The main chemical components of MMC were analyzed using the phenol-sulfuric acid method, aluminum nitrate-sodium nitrite method, and HPLC-ultraviolet/fluorescence detection method. The T2DM rat model was created via feeding a high-fat diet and peritoneal injection of streptozotocin. T2DM rats were divided into four groups: model, model plus metformin, model plus low-dose, and model plus high-dose MMC groups (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively), and plus normal group for a total of five groups. MMC was administered by oral gavage for six weeks. Fasting blood glucose and serum lipid profiles were measured using a glucometer and an automatic biochemistry analyzer, respectively. Serum insulin and adipocytokine levels were analyzed by ELISA. Hepatic glucose metabolizing enzyme activity was evaluated by ELISA and the double antibody sandwich method. Expression of PI-3K/Akt signalling pathway proteins was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Extracted 1-deoxynojirimycin, flavonoid, and polysaccharide purity was 70.40%, 52.34%, and 32.60%, respectively. These components were then mixed at a ratio of 1:6:8 to form MMC. MMC significantly reduced serum glucose, insulin, and lipid levels. In diabetic rats, MMC enhanced insulin sensitivity and alleviated inflammatory and oxidative damage by lowing adipocytokine levels and increasing anti-oxidative enzyme activity. Insulin resistance was also mitigated. MMC regulated the activity of key downstream enzymes of hepatic glucose metabolism via activating the expression of PI-3K, Akt, PDX-1, and GLUT4 at the mRNA and protein levels, thereby correcting hepatic glucolipid metabolism disorders and exerting a hypoglycemic effect. MMC ameliorated hepatic glucolipid metabolism disorders and improved insulin resistance in T2DM rats by activating the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. These results highlight the multi-component, multi-target, and combined effects of MMC, and suggest it may be further developed as a hypoglycemic drug.",Hepatic glucolipid metabolism;Insulin resistance;Mulberry leaves (Morus alba L.);PI-3K/Akt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus,diabetes
Comparative polyphenolic profiling of five ethnomedicinal plants and their applicative potential in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"The medicinal plants Salvia officinalis, Trifolium pratense, Agrimonia eupatoria, Cichorium intybus and Vinca minor are traditionally used for the prevention and treatment of numerous diseases, including diabetes. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common diseases nowadays, often accompanied by oxidative stress and microbial infections. The aim of our work was to examine the antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of ethanol extracts of five medicinal plants for the purpose of their possible use in the treatment of T2D. The polyphenolic profile of the plant extracts was analyzed by Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography with a diode array detector configured with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UHPLC/DAD/(-)HESI-MS2). In vitro antidiabetic activity of extracts was determined by measuring the percentage of α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition. The antioxidant activity of the extract was determined by different spectrophotometric methods, while the antimicrobial activity was determined by agar dilution and disc diffusion methods. A. eupatoria extract contains the highest percentage of flavonoids (94%, with isoquercetin, vitexin, and rutin as the most abundant) in relation to the concentration of total phenolic compounds and exhibits excellent antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activity. S. officinalis extract contains 60% flavonoids (predominately cirismaritin and epigallocatechin gallate) and 40% phenolic acids (with rosmarinic acid being the most abundant from this group) and exhibits weak antidiabetic activity, significant antioxidant activity, and excellent antibacterial activity. A 45% percentage of flavonoids (with isoquercetin as the most abundant one) and 55% of phenolic acids (with ferulic acid as the most abundant) were measured in the extract of T. pratense, which had excellent antidiabetic activity but weaker antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. A similar percentage of flavonoids (52%, with epigallocatechin gallate in the highest concentration) and phenolic acids (48%, with chlorogenic acid as the most abundant) was measured in the extract of C. intybus which showed moderate antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. The extract of V. minor was the richest in phenolic acids (80%, with the most abundant chlorogenic acid), which resulted in weaker antidiabetic and antioxidant activities (except for Fe2+ chelating ability) and antimicrobial activity. The results indicate that specific phenolic compounds are responsible for the different biological activities of the plant extracts. Among the investigated plants, the extract of A. eupatoria has the greatest potential for applications in the treatment of T2D.",Agrimonia eupatoria;Biological activity;Cichorium intybus;Salvia officinalis;Trifolium pratense;Vinca minor,diabetes
A computer-assisted telephone collaborative care intervention provided by lay providers for the treatment of comorbid depression and at-risk drinking: Analysis of a randomized controlled trial.,"Virtual collaborative care for people with comorbid depression and at-risk drinking lacks strong evidence. Our aim was to assess the impact of 12 months of telephone collaborative care (tCC) versus enhanced usual care (eUC) on depression and drinking. We performed a secondary analysis of the Primary care Assessment and Research of a Telephone intervention for Neuropsychiatric conditions with Education and Resources study (PARTNERs), a blinded randomized controlled trial. We examined 144 participants with comorbid depression and at-risk drinking, of which 129 were from the original sample whose data have been published, and 15 were studied since the original report had been published. PARTNERs compared eUC consisting of usual care plus assessment of symptoms at baseline, and 4, 8, and 12 months later vs. tCC consisting of eUC plus telephone-based coaching and symptom monitoring provided by a lay mental health technician to patients supervised by a psychiatrist. The study assessed depression response and remission using logistic regression; we assessed trajectory of drinking using Generalized-estimating equations (GEE). Baseline factors associated with likelihood of not exceeding number of drinks at 12 months were identified using decision trees. tCC produced a faster decline in the number of drinks than eUC (Wald Χ2 = 9.47, p = 0.02). However, drinking and depression outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups at the end of treatment. Higher alcohol consumption at baseline (≥18 standard drinks per week in the tCC group and ≥11 standard drinks per week in the eUC group) was associated with a higher likelihood of having at-risk drinking after 12 months of treatment. Our findings suggest that, compared to eUC, tCC may accelerate drinking reductions in patients with comorbid depression and at-risk drinking. Both treatments were equally effective at the end of treatment for both depression and drinking outcomes.",Alcohol-related disorders;Collaborative care;Depression;Primary care;Randomized clinical trial,diabetes
Pathophysiological Sex-Differences in Heart Failure Progression after Acute Coronary Syndrome: Insights from the EXAMINE Trial.,"Therapies can reduce the risk of heart failure (HF) development and progression in type 2 diabetes (T2D); nevertheless, the risk of these outcomes is greater in females than in males. To investigate sex-differences in HF development and progression, we compared baseline circulating proteins (Olink® Cardiovascular II panel) in males and females with T2D and recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) for the outcome of heart failure hospitalization (HFH). Data were from the placebo-controlled Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) trial. Pathophysiological sex-differences were interpreted with network and pathway overrepresentation analyses. The EXAMINE trial enrolled 5,380 participants (32.1% females) with biomarker data available in 95.4% of individuals. Analyses revealed 43 biomarkers were differentially expressed in HFH, of which 18 were sex-specific. Among these 43 biomarkers, interleukin-6 was identified as a central node for the pathogenesis of HFH in both females and in males. Additional pathway overrepresentation analyses demonstrated that biomarkers associated with inflammatory pathways related to endothelial-dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis were more up-regulated in females than males with HFH. Differential expression of 3 biomarkers (pentraxin-related protein 3, hydroxyacid oxidase 1, and carbonic anhydrase 5A) was independently associated with an increased risk of HFH in females but not in males (interaction p<0.05). In males and females with T2DM and ACS, interleukin-6 appears to be central in the pathogenesis of HF. Females exhibit higher levels of circulating proteins related to immunological pathways, reflecting sex-specific differences underlying HF development and progression.",Diabetes;Epidemiology;Heart Failure;Proteomics;Sex Differences,diabetes
Rationale and design of a randomized trial of the dapagliflozin evaluation on atrial fibrillation patients followed Cox-Maze IV: the DETAIL-CMIV study.,"Dapagliflozin has been widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF). However, data concerning the association between dapagliflozin and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF), especially in patients following Cox Maze IV (CMIV), are rare. We aim to explore the effect of dapagliflozin on the recurrence of AF after CMIV with and without T2DM or HF. The study of dapagliflozin evaluation in atrial fibrillation patients followed by Cox-Maze IV (DETAIL-CMIV) is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 240 AF patients who have received the CMIV procedure will be randomized into the dapagliflozin group (10 mg/day, n=120) and the placebo group (10 mg/day, n=120) and treated for 3 months. The primary endpoint is any documented atrial tachyarrhythmia (AF, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia [AF/AT]) lasting 30 s following a blanking period of 3 months after CMIV. DETAIL-CMIV will determine whether the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, added to guideline-recommended postoperative AF therapies, safely reduces the recurrence rate of AF in patients with and without T2DM or HF.

Wound-healing processes after pulpotomy in the pulp tissue of type 1 diabetes mellitus model rats.,"Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) tend to have delayed wound healing, even in the pulp tissue. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia affects odontoblast-like cell (OLC) differentiation and is involved in macrophage polarization. Accordingly, we evaluated dental pulp stem cell differentiation and macrophage phenotypes after pulpotomy. After modifying DM1 rat models by streptozotocin, 8-week-old rats' upper left first molars were pulpotomized with mineral trioxide aggregate. Meanwhile, the control group was administered saline. Immunohistochemical localization of nestin, osteopontin, α-smooth muscles (α-SMAs), and CD68 (pan-macrophage marker) was conducted 7 days after pulpotomy. The OLC differentiation stage was determined using double immunofluorescence of nestin and α-SMA. Double immunofluorescence of CD68 and iNOS was counted as M1 macrophages and CD68 and CD206 as M2 macrophages. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Thy-1 (CD90) were evaluated by immunofluorescence. In DM1 rats, the reparative dentin bridge was not complete; however, the osteopontin-positive area did not differ significantly from that in controls. PCNA, indicative of cell proliferation, increased in positive cells in DM1 rats compared with controls. Double-positive cells for α-SMA and nestin indicated many immature OLCs in DM1. CD90 was positive only in controls. CD68-positive cells, especially M1 macrophages, were increased in DM1 rats, allowing the inflammatory stage to continue 7 days after pulpotomy. The condition of DM1 model rats can interfere at various stages of the wound healing process, altering OLC differentiation and macrophage polarization. These findings highlight the importance of normal blood glucose concentrations during pulp wound healing.",Dental Pulp healing;odontoblast-like cells;pulpotomy;reparative dentin;type 1 diabetes mellitus,diabetes
Salivary and crevicular fluid proinflammatory cytokines and advanced glycation end products in patients with different glycemic levels undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment.,"To examine whether patients with different blood glycemic levels undergoing fixed orthodontic therapy demonstrate changes in the biochemical profiles of crevicular fluid and salivary advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and proinflammatory cytokine levels in comparison with nondiabetic healthy subjects. Prediabetic subjects, subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and subjects without a diabetes mellitus diagnosis undergoing fixed orthodontic therapy with MBT prescription brackets (0.022-inch brackets and 0.019 × 0.025-inch stainless steel archwires) were included in the study. The following clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated: (1) plaque score (PS), (2) probing depth (PD), (3) bleeding on probing (BOP), and (4) clinical attachment loss. Crevicular fluid and saliva specimens were collected during regular orthodontic visits. Salivary and crevicular fluid tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, ghrelin, resistin, AGEs, and receptor activator of nuclear factor κΒ ligand were evaluated using a human magnetic Luminex multiplex assay. BOP scores were significantly higher among T2DM subjects (19.2%) than among nondiabetic subjects (11.2%) and prediabetic subjects (15.9%). Comparable values were demonstrated by all three study groups regarding PD scores and PSs. T2DM subjects demonstrated higher scores for gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) chemokines than nondiabetic and prediabetic subjects. A statistically significant difference was found in the levels of AGEs and resistin among the three study groups. The scores revealed for the levels of GCF resistin and AGEs versus periodontal BOP demonstrated a significant positive association by the Pearson correlation test. T2DM patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of GCF resistin and AGEs during fixed orthodontic therapy.

Metabolic disorders mediate the relation of miscarriage with cardiovascular diseases.,"The extent to which the contribution of pregnancy loss to cardiovascular diseases can be explained by metabolic disorders is poorly elucidated but holds insights for reducing long-term cardiovascular risk. To investigate the mediating effects of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and lipoprotein metabolism disorders on the association of miscarriage and stillbirth with coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and composite outcomes. A total of 163 283 ever-gravid women (age 55.3 ± 7.9 years) from the UK Biobank cohort without established metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases were included and followed from 2007-2010 baseline until December 2020. Causal mediation analyses were used to estimate the proportion mediated. Hypertension mediated 11.1% (95%CI, 3.7% to 18.5%) of the association between a history of miscarriage and incident CHD. Approximately 9.5% (4.1% to 14.8%) of the effect of recurrent miscarriages on incident CHD was via hypertension, 8.4% (2.5% to 14.3%) of effect was via lipoprotein metabolism disorders, and 1.7% (0.5% to 2.9%) of effect was via DM. 10.7% (0.2% to 21.1%) of the effect of recurrent miscarriages on incident stroke was via hypertension. Hypertension mediated the largest proportion of effect for the atherosclerotic cardiovascular event (15.5% for a history of miscarriage and 9.4% for recurrent miscarriages), followed by lipoprotein metabolism disorders and DM. Hypertension, DM, and lipoprotein metabolism disorders mediated the association between miscarriage and various cardiovascular outcomes in later life. In particular, hypertension mediated a large proportion of the relation between miscarriage and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",Hypertension;cardiovascular diseases;metabolic disorders;miscarriage,diabetes
Alpinia officinarum Hance extract ameliorates diabetic gastroparesis by regulating SCF/c-kit signaling pathway and rebalancing gut microbiota.,"Diabetic gastroparesis (DGP) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Alpinia officinarum Hance (AOH) is one of the most commonly used both as a food and folk medicines, which is rich in diarylheptanoids and flavonoids. The gastroprotection and hypoglycemic effect make AOH has great potential in developing of anti-DGP complementary medicine. However, the molecular mechanisms of AOH that act against DGP are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects, the potential molecular mechanism, and the changes of gut microbiota of AOH in DGP. The 5 components of the AOH were analyzed, and the potential signaling pathway of AOH improving DGP was predicted by molecular docking. Subsequently, DGP rat model was constructed using high-fat-irregular-diet, AOH intervention significantly reduced blood glucose levels, increased gastrointestinal propulsion rate, and improved gastric histological morphology in DGP rats. Meanwhile, AOH has been shown to regulate the SCF/c-kit signaling pathway and rebalance the gut microbiota, which may be closely related to its role in improving DGP. Taken together, AOH may play a protective role on DGP through multiple mechanisms, which might pave the road for development and utilization of AOH.",Alpinia officinarum Hance;Diabetic gastroparesis;Gut microbiota;Molecular docking;SCF/c-kit signaling pathway,diabetes
Triglyceride-glucose index as a predictor of obstructive sleep apnoea severity in the absence of traditional risk factors.,"We evaluated the association between the triglyceride-glucose (TG) index, a marker of insulin resistance, and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity in patients without diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. This retrospective cohort study included 1,527 patients. We used univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the independent predictors associated with OSA. Most patients were males (81.5%) with a mean age of 43.9 ± 11.1 (15-90) years. Based on the apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI), 353 (23.1%) patients were included in the control group, whereas 32.4%, 23.5%, and 21% had mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. The TG index values demonstrated significant associations with OSA patients compared with the control group (p = 0.001). In addition, the mean values of the oxygen desaturation index (ODI), AHI, minimum oxygen saturation, and total sleep time percentage with saturation below 90% demonstrated statistically significant differences among the TG index groups (p: 0.001; p:0.001; p:0.001; p:0.003). The optimal TG index cutoff value to predict OSA was 8.615 (AUC = 0.638, 95% CI = 0.606-0.671, p = 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index, the TG index was independently associated with OSA patients. The TG index is independently associated with increased risk for OSA. This indicates that this index, a marker for disease severity, can be used to identify severe OSA patients on waiting lists for PSG.","D008297:Male;D006801:Humans;D000328:Adult;D008875:Middle Aged;D005260:Female;D014280:Triglycerides;D005947:Glucose;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D012307:Risk Factors;D020181:Sleep Apnea, Obstructive",diabetes
Dilated optic nerve sheath by ultrasound predicts mortality among patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a deadly disease and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is associated with worse outcomes in this context. We evaluated whether dilated optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) depicted by optic nerve ultrasound (ONUS) at hospital admission has prognostic value as a predictor of mortality at 90 days. Prospective multicenter study of acute supratentorial primary ICH patients consecutively recruited from two tertiary stroke centers. Optic nerve ultrasound and cranial computed tomography (CT) scans were performed at hospital admission and blindly reviewed. The primary outcome was mortality at 90-days. Multivariate logistic regression, ROC curve, and C-statistics were used to identify independent predictors of mortality. Between July 2014 and July 2016, 57 patients were evaluated. Among those, 13 were excluded and 44 were recruited into the trial. Their mean age was 62.3 ± 13.1 years and 12 (27.3%) were female. On univariate analysis, ICH volume on cranial CT scan, ICH ipsilateral ONSD, Glasgow coma scale, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and glucose on admission, and also diabetes mellitus and current nonsmoking were predictors of mortality. After multivariate analysis, ipsilateral ONSD (odds ratio [OR]: 6.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-33.01; p = 0.03) was an independent predictor of mortality, even after adjustment for other relevant prognostic factors. The best ipsilateral ONSD cutoff was 5.6mm (sensitivity 72% and specificity 83%) with an AUC of 0.71 (p = 0.02) for predicting mortality at 90 days. Optic nerve ultrasound is a noninvasive, bedside, low-cost technique that can be used to identify increased ICP in acute supratentorial primary ICH patients. Among these patients, dilated ONSD is an independent predictor of mortality at 90 days.",D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D008875:Middle Aged;D000368:Aged;D008297:Male;D011446:Prospective Studies;D007427:Intracranial Pressure;D002543:Cerebral Hemorrhage;D014463:Ultrasonography;D020521:Stroke;D009900:Optic Nerve;D019586:Intracranial Hypertension,diabetes
Correlation of plasma adiponectin levels and adiponectin gene polymorphisms with idiopathic atrial fibrillation.,"Adiponectin is a cellular protein secreted by adipocytes, which is closely related to a variety of diseases, including atrial fibrillation(AF). Idiopathic atrial fibrillation(IAF) is defined as AF without hypertension, diabetes and other underlying diseases.Genetic polymorphism of adiponectin affects serum adiponectin concentration. However, the association of serum adiponectin concentration and its genetic polymorphism with IAF has not been studied,This study investigated the relationship between serum levels of adiponectin, adiponectin gene polymorphisms, and the risk of developing IAF in a Chinese Han population. Patients with IAF (n=172, IAF group) and healthy individuals (n=150, control group) were consecutively and randomly recruited and fasting peripheral blood samples were collected. All participants were examined for serum adiponectin concentrations and the polymorphisms SNP45T>G (SmaI locus, rs2241766) and SNP276G>T (BsmI locus, rs1501299) of the adiponectin gene were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Related clinical data from the two groups were also collected. Plasma adiponectin levels in the IAF group were significantly lower than those in the control group (9.9±2.6 mg/L vs 16.1±7.0 mg/L, p=0.006). There were no significant differences among the three genotypes (wild type, mutant heterozygote, and homozygote) of SNP45T>G or SNP276G>T in the prediction value of IAF. The frequency of the T allele of SNP45 T>G was 70.3% in the IAF group and significantly different from that of the control group (71.3%; P = 0.02). In the case of SNP276G>T, the frequency of the G allele was 68.61% in patients with IAF compared to 73.34% in the control group (P = 0.35). Furthermore, comparison of the clinical data of individuals in the two groups revealed that the left atrial diameter (LAD) in patients in the IAF group was obviously higher than that in the control group (43.3±6.7 mm vs 37.9±5.1 mm, respectively; p<0.001). The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the IAF group was obviously reduced than that in the control group (54.7±11.9% vs 60.2±5.6%, respectively; p<0.001). Low plasma adiponectin levels were significantly associated with IAF. Hypoadiponectinemia can thus serve as an important factor for the incidence of IAF . The genotypes of SNP45T>G and SNP276G>T in the adiponectin gene may not correlate with the occurrence of IAF. However, our results demonstrate that the T allele of SNP45T>G may be responsible for IAF development in the Chinese Han population.",,diabetes

The current state of preclinical modeling of human diabetic cardiomyopathy using rodents.,"The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a specific cardiovascular complication of diabetes mellitus, has recently increased. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood, and no consensus regarding therapeutic options has been reached. Experimental studies on rodents are expected to yield further data at the preclinical stage. The present paper describes and quantitatively compares the experimental protocols intended to mimic human DCM. Experimental articles (conducted between 1990 and 2022) were identified from online electronic databases according to the PRISMA Protocol. The Cochrane Q-test was used to estimate study heterogeneity; the quality of each individual study was assessed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. Sensitivity analysis was performed according to the leave-one-out method. Publication bias across studies was assessed using Egger's weighted regression and Duval and Tweedie 'trim and fill' method. A wide spectrum of protocols - from 651 papers, was examined (type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as obesity models). They were found to vary in their presentation of DCM according to a variety of hemodynamic, echocardiographic, histopathologic and metabolic parameters. Particular attention was paid to comorbid conditions, and cardiac performance featured as systolic, diastolic dysfunction, or refractory heart failure. The majority of models displayed diastolic dysfunction, as well as myocardial fibrosis and left ventricle hypertrophy, which mimics early stage DCM. Unlike in humans, animal DCM rarely progressed to the symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The ability of individual procedures to reflect refractory heart failure or biventricular dysfunction - in the end-stage DCM has remained unclear.",Diabetes;Diabetic cardiomyopathy;Heart failure;Meta-research;Rodents,diabetes
Circular RNAs: An emerging precise weapon for diabetic nephropathy diagnosis and therapy.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a prevalent chronic microvascular complication associated with diabetes mellitus and represents a major cause of chronic kidney disease and renal failure. Current treatment strategies for DN primarily focus on symptom alleviation, lacking effective approaches to halt or reverse DN progression. Circular RNA (circRNA), characterized by a closed-loop structure, has emerged as a novel non-coding RNA regulator of gene expression, attributed to its conservation, stability, specificity, and multifunctionality. Dysregulation of circRNA expression is closely associated with DN progression, whereby circRNA impacts kidney cell injury by modulating cell cycle, differentiation, cell death, as well as influencing the release of inflammatory factors and stromal fibronectin expression. Consequently, circRNA is considered a predictive biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for DN. This review provides an overview of the latest research progress in the classification, functions, monitoring methods, and databases related to circRNA. The paper focuses on elucidating the impact and underlying mechanisms of circRNA on kidney cells under diabetic conditions, aiming to offer novel insights into the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of DN.",Biomarker;Circular RNA;Database;Diabetes nephropathy;Therapeutic target,diabetes
Group-based patient education via videoconference: A scoping review.,"To summarize recent evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of videoconference (VC) group-based patient and caregiver education. Systematic searches of the literature were conducted. Data was extracted on the characteristics of the studies and interventions and on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the interventions. From 12,570 hits, 65 studies were eligible for inclusion. Their results confirmed previously identified tendencies of high feasibility and acceptability of VC group patient education, and improved health outcomes. However, evidence of effectiveness is limited, and the quality of studies is varied. Several patient and caregiver groups also remain under-researched. Only four studies stated that facilitators were trained in using VC-technology. VC group-based patient and caregiver education is feasible and acceptable and may improve health outcomes for participant patients and caregivers. However future research should increase the number of high-quality randomized controlled trials to establish the effectiveness of VC group-based education for several groups of patients and caregivers. Studies of the training of facilitators is also warranted. The results suggest that interventions should be more accessible. An overview of the recent evidence may also stimulate the development and evaluation of VC group-based patient and caregiver education.",Patient education;Scoping review;Videoconference,diabetes
Association between falls and nonmotor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder. Falls are common in patients with PD and can lead to disability, bedridden status, and death. The mechanisms of falls induced by symptoms of PD have not been fully clarified. We investigated the association between falls and nonmotor symptoms in PD patients. A total of 361 patients with Parkinson's disease were included. Whether the patients had fallen in the past half a year was recorded. Nonmotor symptoms were assessed by 30 items from the nonmotor symptom questionnaire (NMS Quest), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA). A total of 63 patients experienced falls in the past six months, with an incidence of 17.5%. The patients with falls were elderly, had severe motor symptoms and disease severity, and the proportion of diabetic patients who experienced falls was higher. Adjusted for the above factors, the results showed that patients with falls had higher PD-NMS, HAMD and HAMA scores, but there was no significant difference in the total score and subscores of the MoCA scale between the two groups. The risk factors related to falling included age, history of diabetes, depression (HAMD), HAMD cognitive impairment, NMS urinary tract and NMS postural hypotension. Falls were a common symptom in patients with PD and were not only related to motor symptoms but also closely related to nonmotor symptoms. urinary tract symptoms, postural hypotension, depression and HAMD cognitive impairment were risk factors related to falling in patients with PD.",Falls;Motor symptoms;Nonmotor symptoms;Parkinson's disease,diabetes
Precision measurements of relaxation rates of degenerate ,"An NMR experiment is designed for accurate and robust measurement of transverse relaxation rates of degenerate 1H transitions in selectively 13CH3-labeled, deuterated small proteins. The measurement is based on the use of acute (<90°) angle 1H radio-frequency pulses and relies on selection of the slow- and fast-relaxing components of methyl magnetization following the relaxation period in separate experiments. The R2 decay series recorded with selection of the fast-relaxing components serves as a useful complement to the R2 series acquired with selection of the slow-relaxing part, and permits the extension of the range of relative contributions of the fast- and slow-relaxing parts to apparent signal decay. The approach is experimentally verified on 13CH3 methyl groups of the ILV-{13CH3}-labeled protein ubiquitin at 10 °C and 25 °C. The obtained methyl 1H relaxation rates are in remarkably good agreement with the values obtained from well-established NMR techniques.",(1)H relaxation in magnetically equivalent spin-systems;(13)CH(3) spin-system;Acute angle RF pulses;Methyl NMR,diabetes
The prevalence of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To estimate the overall prevalence of glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with insulin. Systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses from 2000 to January 2022. Cross-sectional studies were included if they were conducted on more than 292 patients with T2D and reported the number of insulin-treated patients who were justified as achieving glycemic control. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Pooled estimates of the prevalence of glycemic control were calculated and reported with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using a random-effects model. All analyses were conducted using RStudio Version 2022.02.0, Build 443 (meta package). A total of 42 studies (234,345 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were classified as having a low risk of bias. The overall estimated prevalence of glycemic control to insulin therapy among patients with T2D was 26.02% (95% CI: 23.17, 29.08). A subgroup of 34 studies that set the target HbA1c <7% showed that 23.75% (95% CI: 21.47, 26.18) of patients with T2D treated with insulin were justified as achieving good glycemic control. This study provided summative evidence that glycemic control among patients with T2D treated with insulin was suboptimal and should be appropriately addressed.",Glycemic control;Insulin;Prevalence;Type 2 diabetes,diabetes
"Synthesis, biological evaluation and action mechanism of 7H-[1,2,4] triazolo [3,4-b] [1,3,4] thiadiazine-phenylhydrazone derivatives as α-glucosidase inhibitors.","In our work, several 7H-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine-phenylhydrazone derivatives as α-glucosidase inhibitors (α-GIs) were synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS spectrum. Then, their bio-activity against the α-glucosidase (α-Glu) was further evaluated. Among them, almost all compounds displayed better bio-activity with IC50 from 31.23 ± 0.89 to 213.50 ± 4.19 μM than acarbose (IC50 = 700.20 ± 10.55 μM). In particular, compound 5o showed the best potency to inhibit α-Glu in a mixed manner. Moreover, the action mechanisms of 5o were further clarified including fluorescence quenching, circular dichroism spectra, three-dimensional fluorescence spectra, molecular docking, etc. All mechanism studies revealed that 5o could arouse the changed secondary structure of α-Glu to hinder enzyme catalytic activity. It was observed from an in vivo study that 5o of 20 mg/kg could significantly decrease by 24.45 % postprandial blood glucose in mice vs. the control. Meanwhile, 5o had low drug-drug interaction potential and was likely to be an orally active compound. Moreover, 5o was observed to be no obvious cytotoxicity to HEK-293 cells. In summary, compound 5o exhibited one potential to be further applied as an antidiabetic drug.",Diabetes mellitus;Inhibition mechanism;Postprandial blood glucose;α-Glucosidase,diabetes
A systematic review exploring the mechanisms by which citrus bioflavonoid supplementation benefits blood glucose levels and metabolic complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Citrus bioflavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are derived from citrus fruits and vegetables. Although they are well known for their powerful antioxidant properties, their effects on glycemic control are not well understood. This review aims to highlight the potential benefits of using citrus bioflavonoids in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its metabolic complications, as well as the medicinal effects of known subclasses of naturally occurring citrus bioflavonoids. In this systematic review, a survey of studies was conducted from January 2012 to February 2023 using various databases (PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Scopus) to determine the effects of citrus bioflavonoid supplementation on reducing oxidative stress, improving lipid profiles, and glycemic index in patients with diabetes mellitus, as well as the proposed mechanisms of action. The results of the survey indicate that citrus bioflavonoids may have a positive impact on reducing oxidative stress levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to reducing oxidative stress, citrus bioflavonoids may also have a positive impact on other markers of diabetes. For example, studies have shown that they can reduce non-enzymatic protein glycation, which is a process that occurs when glucose molecules bind to proteins in the body. The reduction in oxidative stress that can be achieved using citrus bioflavonoids may help to maintain antioxidant levels in the body, thereby reducing the severity of diabetes and its complications. These findings suggest that citrus bioflavonoids may be a useful complementary therapy for patients with diabetes.",Antioxidants;Bioflavonoids;Blood glucose levels;Oxidative stress;Type 2 diabetes mellitus,diabetes
Advances in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes: Current status and future directions.,"The aim of this review is to give an update of the recent advances in the pathophysiology, prognosis, diagnosis and treatments of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). The literature survey focuses on original and review articles dealing with CFRD between 2006 and 2023, and in particular with: pathophysiology, risk and predictive factors, screening, chronic complications of CFRD, management and the effects of CFTR channel modulator therapies on glucose homeostasis, using PubMed®. The rising prevalence of CFRD is due to prolonged life survival among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology highlight the singularity of CFRD. Adherence to diagnostic guidelines remains challenging. Besides the classical OGTT, alternative diagnostic tests are being considered: HbA1c measurement, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), intermediate measurements of alternative glucose tolerance stages through OGTT and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Early treatment of (pre)diabetes in CF patients is mandatory. The advent of CFTR channel modulator therapies have created a paradigm shift in the management of CF: they seem to improve glucose homeostasis, but the mechanism remains unclear. CFRD management is an ongoing concern. Optimal care has reduced the negative impact of CFRD on lung function, nutrition, and survival. Increasing prevalence of CFRD and prolonged lifespan lead to more microvascular complications. New screening tools (Hba1c, CGM, HOMA) show potential for better classification of patients. The effect of CFTR modulators on glucose metabolism warrants further research.",CFTR modulator therapy;Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes;Pathophysiology;Prognosis;Screening methods,diabetes
Biohybrid tongue based on hypothalamic neuronal network-on-a-chip for real-time blood glucose sensing and assessment.,"The expression of sweet receptors in the hypothalamus has been implicated in energy homeostasis control and the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. However, the exact mechanism by which hypothalamic glucose-sensing neurons function remains unclear. Conventional detection methods, such as fiber photometry, optogenetics, brain-machine interfaces, patch clamp and calcium imaging, pose limitations for real-time glucose perception due to their complexity, cytotoxicity and so on. Therefore, this study proposes a biohybrid tongue based on hypothalamic neuronal network (HNN)-on-a-chip coupling with microelectrode array (MEA) for real-time glucose perception. Hypothalamic neuronal cultures were cultivated on a two-dimensional ""brain-on-chip"" device, enabling the formation of neuronal networks and electrophysiological signal detection. Additionally, we investigated the endogenous expression of sweet taste receptors (T1R2/T1R3) in hypothalamic neuronal cells, providing the basis for the biohybrid tongue based on HNN-on-a-chip's sweetness detection capabilities. The spike signal response to sucrose and glucose stimulation was detected, and concentration-dependent responses were explored with glucose concentrations ranging from 0.01 mM to 8 mM. MEAs allow for real-time recordings, enabling the observation of dynamic changes in neuronal responses to glucose fluctuations over time. The biohybrid tongue based on HNN-on-a-chip can measure various parameters, including spike frequency and amplitude, providing insights into neuronal firing patterns and excitability. Moreover, hypothalamic glucoregulatory neurons that sense and respond to changes in blood glucose was identified, including glucose-excited neurons (GE-Neurons) and glucose-inhibited neurons (GI-Neurons). The detection range for GE-Neurons spans from 0.4 to 6 mM, while GI-Neurons demonstrate sensitivity within the range of 1-8 mM. And the glucose detection limit was firmly established at 0.01 mM. Through non-linear regression analysis, the IC50 for GI-Neurons' spike firing was determined to be 4.18 mM. In conclusion, the biohybrid tongue based on HNN-on-a-chip offers a valuable in vitro tool for studying hypothalamic neurons, elucidating glucose sensing mechanisms, and understanding hypothalamic neuronal function.",Cell-based biosensor;Glucose-sensitive neurons;Hypothalamic neuronal network;Microelectrode array;Sweet receptors,diabetes
Highly Absorbent Egg White/ Carbomer-940 Hydrofilm as A Potential Diabetic Wound Dressing.,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the most critical problem in diabetic patients. Managing exudate in this kind of wound presents significant challenges in clinics. Advanced wound dressings serve as the most effective approach to managing DFU. Herein, a highly absorbent hydrofilm is presented through a combination of egg white (EW) and Carbomer-940, benefiting from the bioactivity of the EW component and superabsorption capacity of Carbomer-940. The crystallinity of samples rises due to the presence of Carbomer-940. Regarding the high water absorption capacity of Carbomer-940, the swelling ratio and water-holding capacity of samples are also improved via its incorporation of up to 1005%. In contrast the transmission of water vapor and in-vitro degradation rate decreases as carbomer-940 powers the crystallinity of hydrofilms. Carbomer-940 incorporation in the EW structure accelerates protein release during the time, while this acceleration is partially compensated by the crystallization effect. The cell viability assay demonstrates no toxicity as well as high human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cell proliferation for the hybrid hydrofilm sample, where the cell migration is positively affected in the presence of the bioactive components extracted from the dressing. Taken together, the optimized hybrid hydrofilm could be suggested as a promising wound dressing for managing DFUs. This article is protected by copyright.

Edible Red Seaweed ,"Metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease, are dramatically increasing around the world. Seaweed is low in calories and rich in many active ingredients that are necessary for maintaining good health, and is expected to be effective for preventing metabolic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a traditional Japanese edible seaweed Hypnea asiatica (H. asiatica) on obesity, using a mouse model. H. asiatica was dried and powdered, mixed with a high-fat diet, and fed to male C57BL/6J mice for 13 weeks. On the last day of the experiment, blood samples were collected under anesthesia and biochemical parameters such as lipids and adipokines were measured. Liver and adipose tissue were excised, weighed, and oxidant/antioxidant parameters were measured. Some mice were perfused with a fixative solution containing formalin, and tissue specimens were prepared. A glucose tolerance test was used to assess insulin resistance. The inhibition of lipase activity was evaluated in vitro. Thirteen-week supplementation with H. asiatica suppressed body weight gain, body fat accumulation, and blood glucose levels. H. asiatica also improved fatty liver and hypercholesterolemia, and reduced the oxidant and inflammatory parameters of serum and liver. H. asiatica increased fecal triglyceride excretion and polyphenol-rich ethanol extract of H. asiatica inhibited lipase activity in vitro. These results suggest that polysaccharides and polyphenols in H. asiatica may ameliorate obesity and diabetes by inhibiting intestinal fat absorption and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. H. asiatica may be useful in preventing metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver.","D008297:Male;D000818:Animals;D051379:Mice;D059305:Diet, High-Fat;D012624:Seaweed;D008810:Mice, Inbred C57BL;D009765:Obesity;D008099:Liver;D065626:Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease;D003920:Diabetes Mellitus;D007333:Insulin Resistance;D016877:Oxidants;D008049:Lipase",diabetes
Foxj3 regulates thermogenesis of brown and beige fat via induction of PGC-1α.,"Enhancing the development and thermogenesis in brown and beige fat represents a potential treatment for obesity. In the present study, we show that Foxj3 expression in fat is stimulated by cold exposure and a β-adrenergic agonist. Adipose-specific Foxj3 knockout impairs the thermogenic function of brown fat, leading to morphological whitening of brown fat and obesity. Adipose Foxj3-deficient mice display increased fasting blood glucose levels and hepatic steatosis on a chow diet. Foxj3 deficiency inhibits the browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) following β3-agonist treatment of mice. Furthermore, depletion of Foxj3 in primary brown adipocytes reduces the expression of thermogenic genes and cellular respiration, indicating that the Foxj3 effects on the thermogenic program are cell autonomous. In contrast, Foxj3 overexpression in primary brown adipocytes enhances the thermogenic program. Moreover, AAV-mediated Foxj3 overexpression in brown fat and inguinal WAT increases energy expenditure and improves systemic metabolism on either a chow diet or a high-fat diet. Finally, Foxj3 deletion in fat inhibits the β3 agonist-mediated induction of WAT browning and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Mechanistically, cold-inducible Foxj3 stimulates the expression of PGC-1α and UCP1, subsequently promoting energy expenditure. The present study identifies Foxj3 as a critical regulator of fat thermogenesis, and targeting Foxj3 in fat might be a therapeutic strategy for treating obesity and metabolic diseases.",,diabetes
Role of glycosuria in SGLT2 inhibitor-induced cardio-renal protection: a mechanistic analysis of the CREDENCE trial.,"SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to provide pronounced reductions in cardio-renal outcomes, including cardiovascular death, heart failure, and renal failure. The mechanisms underlying these benefits remain uncertain. We hypothesized that the effects could be attributed to the elevated glycosuria induced by these drugs. Urine concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and ketones were measured at baseline and after 1-year treatment with either placebo or canagliflozin 100mg/day in ∼2600 individuals from the CREDENCE trial (enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and albuminuria). Associations between glycosuria and the primary composite endpoint from CREDENCE and secondary outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Canagliflozin treatment increased fractional urinary glucose excretion from 3±9% at baseline to 30±26% at year 1 (vs 5±19% with placebo, p<0.001). Subjects on canagliflozin and in the top quartile of urine glucose/creatinine ratio at year 1 were significantly protected for the primary endpoint (HR=0.42 [95% C.I.:0.30-0.61]); similar results were seen for hospitalized heart failure (HR=0.45 [0.27-0.73]) and all-cause death (HR=0.56 [0.39-0.80]). These associations persisted on adjustments for multiple conventional risk factors. In patients with T2D and CKD treated with canagliflozin, individuals with the highest amount of glycosuria showed the strongest protection against multiple cardio-renal outcomes.",,diabetes
Single-cell genomics reveals region-specific developmental trajectories underlying neuronal diversity in the human hypothalamus.,"The development and diversity of neuronal subtypes in the human hypothalamus has been insufficiently characterized. To address this, we integrated transcriptomic data from 241,096 cells (126,840 newly generated) in the prenatal and adult human hypothalamus to reveal a temporal trajectory from proliferative stem cell populations to mature hypothalamic cell types. Iterative clustering of the adult neurons identified 108 robust transcriptionally distinct neuronal subtypes representing 10 hypothalamic nuclei. Pseudotime trajectories provided insights into the genes driving formation of these nuclei. Comparisons to single-cell transcriptomic data from the mouse hypothalamus suggested extensive conservation of neuronal subtypes despite certain differences in species-enriched gene expression. The uniqueness of hypothalamic neuronal lineages was examined developmentally by comparing excitatory lineages present in cortex and inhibitory lineages in ganglionic eminence, revealing both distinct and shared drivers of neuronal maturation across the human forebrain. These results provide a comprehensive transcriptomic view of human hypothalamus development through gestation and adulthood at cellular resolution.",D051379:Mice;D000818:Animals;D006801:Humans;D007031:Hypothalamus;D009474:Neurons;D059467:Transcriptome;D020869:Gene Expression Profiling;D023281:Genomics,diabetes
Erythritol as a potential causal contributor to cardiometabolic disease: A Mendelian randomization study.,"People with type 2 diabetes frequently use low-calorie sweeteners to manage glycemia and reduce caloric intake. Use of erythritol, a low-calorie sweetener, has increased recently. Higher circulating concentration associates with major cardiac events and metabolic disease in observational data, prompting some concern. As observational data may be prone to confounding and reverse causality, we undertook bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate potential causal associations between erythritol and coronary artery disease (CAD), body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), glycemic and renal traits in cohorts of European ancestry. Analyses were undertaken using instruments comprising genome-wide-significant variants from three cohorts with erythritol measurement. Across instruments, we did not find supportive evidence that increased erythritol increases CAD (b=-0.033±0.02, p=0.14; b=0.46±0.37, p=0.23). MR indicates erythritol may decrease BMI (b=-0.04±0.018, p=0.03; b=-0.04±0.0085, p=1.23x10-5; b=-0.083±0.092, p=0.036) with potential evidence from one instrument of increased BMI adjusted for waist-hip ratio (b=0.046±0.022, p=0.035). No evidence of causal association was found with other traits. In conclusion, we did not find supportive evidence from MR that erythritol increases cardiometabolic disease. These findings await confirmation in well-designed prospective studies.",,diabetes
Assessing the vibration perception threshold in a community sample of adult Ghanaians.,"The vibration perception threshold (VPT) helps evaluate human somatosensory function and diagnose peripheral neuropathy. To optimize its use as a primary neurologic tool, it is imperative to establish its typical values in healthy subjects and assess the factors affecting its variability in an individual to ensure consistency in its application. Demographic data and a brief medical history were collected from 391 non-diabetic adults aged 30-80 at Kpone-on-Sea in Ghana. The VPT was measured at the tip of the big toe, the medial malleolus, the tip of the middle finger, and the head of the ulna of each participant using a Horwell Neurothesiometer. The variability of VPT was assessed vis-à-vis the following factors: gender, age, fasting plasma sugar and body mass index. The mean age of participants was 48.4 ± 0.7 years, and the female-to-male ratio was 1.46. The overall VPT values ranged from 5.74 ± 0.14 volts to 8.55 ± 0.18 volts in the lower limbs and 3.61 ± 0.06 volts to 5.00 ± 0.08 volts in the upper limbs. Age was found to be the only factor that could predict VPT for both the lower and upper limbs (P < 0.001). One-Way Analysis of Variance with Tukey's posthoc showed that the VPT in the feet was significantly higher than that in the hands. Generally, the VPT was high on proximal sites and low on distal sites indicating that the vibration sensation increased from proximal to distal direction. Therefore, distal areas should be used for VPT testing with a Neurothesiomer. Age was found to be the only factor that affected VPT variability. Hence, the practical application of VPT will require age-specific reference ranges to cater for older adults.",D006801:Humans;D008297:Male;D005260:Female;D000368:Aged;D008875:Middle Aged;D005869:Ghana;D012684:Sensory Thresholds;D014732:Vibration;D012677:Sensation;D005528:Foot;D003929:Diabetic Neuropathies,diabetes
Uptake of diabetic retinopathy screening at a secondary level facility in Malawi.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication of long-standing diabetes mellitus (DM). DR screening is a cost-effective intervention for preventing blindness from DR. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the uptake and the predictors of uptake of annual DR screening in an opportunistic DR screening programme at a secondary-level diabetes clinic in Southern Malawi. Consecutive patients were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to record their demographic characteristics, medical details and data regarding; the frequency of clinic visits, knowledge of existence of DR screening services and a history of referral for DR screening in the prior one year. Univariate binary logistic regression was used to investigate predictors of DR screening uptake over the prior one year. Explanatory variables that had a P-value of < 0.1 were included into a multivariate logistic regression model. All variables that had a p-value of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. We recruited 230 participants over three months with a median age of 52.5 years (IQR 18-84) and a median duration of diabetes of 4 years (IQR 1-7). The average interval of clinic visits was 1.2 months (SD ± 0.43) and only 59.1% (n = 139) of the participants were aware of the existence of diabetic retinopathy screening services at the facility. The uptake for DR screening over one year was 20% (n = 46). The strongest predictors of uptake on univariate analysis were awareness of the existence of DR screening services (OR 10.05, P <0.001) and a history of being referred for DR screening (OR 9.02, P <0.001) and these remained significant on multivariable analysis. Interventions to improve uptake for DR screening should promote referral of patients for DR screening and strengthen knowledge about the need and availability of DR screening services.",,diabetes
Promoting kidney health in people with type 2 diabetes: part 2.,"The incidence of chronic kidney disease is increasing internationally with many risk factors for chronic kidney disease also being risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Nurses should use primary, secondary and tertiary prevention to minimise the incidence of chronic kidney disease when caring for individuals with type 2 diabetes. This article is the second in a two-part series on the interrelationship between these long-term conditions. Part 1 addressed the significance of using primary prevention to promote kidney health in adults living with type 2 diabetes; part 2 will discuss the use of secondary and tertiary prevention relevant to these long-term conditions.","D000328:Adult;D006801:Humans;D003924:Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2;D051436:Renal Insufficiency, Chronic;D012307:Risk Factors;D007668:Kidney",diabetes
Integration of transcriptomes of senescent cell models with multi-tissue patient samples reveals reduced COL6A3 as an inducer of senescence.,"Senescent cells are a major contributor to age-dependent cardiovascular tissue dysfunction, but knowledge of their in vivo cell markers and tissue context is lacking. To reveal tissue-relevant senescence biology, we integrate the transcriptomes of 10 experimental senescence cell models with a 224 multi-tissue gene co-expression network based on RNA-seq data of seven tissues biopsies from ∼600 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. We identify 56 senescence-associated modules, many enriched in CAD GWAS genes and correlated with cardiometabolic traits-which supports universality of senescence gene programs across tissues and in CAD. Cross-tissue network analyses reveal 86 candidate senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, including COL6A3. Experimental knockdown of COL6A3 induces transcriptional changes that overlap the majority of the experimental senescence models, with cell-cycle arrest linked to modulation of DREAM complex-targeted genes. We provide a transcriptomic resource for cellular senescence and identify candidate biomarkers, SASP factors, and potential drivers of senescence in human tissues.",COL6A3;CP: Cell biology;cellular senescence;collagen;disease;human;integration;network;transcriptomic,diabetes
Lipidome and inflammation interplay: the role of diet in this relationship.,"The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the role of novel lipid biomarkers from the circulating lipidome in inflammatory processes and the impact that dietary patterns may have on the lipidome. Inflammation is a process that underlies many acute and chronic diseases, contributing to their development and severity. Finding novel molecules which serve as biomarkers and which are involved in inflammation is very useful, since they offer us both preventive or therapeutic targets and reveal mechanisms of action. Recently, several studies have found circulating lipid molecules that are implicated in inflammatory processes of different diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 or other respiratory infectious diseases. As such, ceramides, triacylglicerides or lysophosphatidylcholines have been associated with inflammation in a different manner depending on the stage of inflammation. The study of dietary patterns, especially healthy ones as the Mediterranean or the Nordic diets, has shown the impact that dietary habits may have on the lipidomic profile of individuals. Healthy dietary patterns have been suggested to exert beneficial effects in the circulating lipid profile. Studying the circulating lipidome could help to find new biomarkers of underlying inflammation, especially in cases of chronic low-grade inflammatory diseases in which it is more difficult to detect.",,diabetes
FEATURES OF THE PROCESS OF TRAINING IN EDUCATIONAL MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS OF UKRAINE AT THE PRESENT STAGE. PART 2. REACTION OF HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO DISTANCE LEARNING.,"Higher education is one of the areas most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and martial law. Against the backdrop of severe restrictions, universities faced the issue of the existing opportunities for the implementation of educational programs, the need to change the format of the educational process with the transition mainly to electronic educational technologies. Under these conditions, it was necessary to consolidate all the forces and resources of the university community. The governments of many countries have recognized the need to provide infrastructural and technological support to educational institutions. Thanks to the institutional support of the state and relevant ministries, universities managed to reduce financial losses and implement initiatives for continuous education. These measures have contributed to the sustainability of universities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions all over the world have adopted different approaches and made significant changes to the education system itself in accordance with their resources and capabilities.",  martial law ; COVID-19 pandemic  ; distance learning ; educational medical institutions  ; medical students  ,pandemic
CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF COVID-19 IN CHILDREN FOR THE PERIOD 2020-2022.,"The aim: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children for the period 2020-2022. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of 1144 case histories of children who were hospitalized at the St. Zinaida Children's Clinical Hospital (Sumy, Ukraine) for coronavirus disease for 2020-2022 was carried out. The observed patients were divided into 3 groups corresponding to the 3 waves of the pandemic: group 1 - 120 children, group 2 - 311 children, and group 3 - 713. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was established based on clinical, medical histories, laboratory and instrumental data. The etiology of coronavirus disease was determined based on the detection of antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using PCR reverse transcription of a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: An analysis of the clinical and epidemiological indicators of children who were treated for COVID-19 during 2020-2022 was conducted, depending on the outbreak of the pandemic. The frequency of lesions in children of different age groups was determined, and the main clinical symptoms and the frequency of complications in the form of pneumonia during different waves of COVID-19 were determined. Conclusions: The incidence of coronavirus infection was mainly observed in children of the younger group (0-5 years). A more severe course of the disease and a higher frequency of complications in the form of pneumonia in children were determined during the 3rd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.", COVID-19 ; SARS-CoV-2 ; children ; coronavirus infection ; pneumonia ,pandemic
PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER IN UKRAINE.,"The aim: To analyze the prevalence of breast cancer from 2014 to 2022 and the incidence rate in the population of Ukraine. Materials and methods: The methods used in the research include historical-biographical analysis, content analysis, and a systemic approach. Results: According to the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine, from 2014 to 2020, there were stable figures of malignant neoplasms (MN) with a 1% increase in morbidity. The lowest rate was observed in 2014, with 135.307 new cases of MN, showing a slight increase until 2019 with 138.509 new cases. Starting from 2020, there has been a decrease in the registration of new MN cases, such as 113.368 new cases in 2020, in 2021-120.055, and 93.276 in 2022. The decrease in new MN cases is attributed to limited access to medical services for the population residing in annexed territories and areas affected by ongoing military actions. Conclusions: A relatively stable increase in breast cancer incidence is observed from 2014 to 2020, within a 1% range, followed by a sharp decrease from 2020 to 2022. This decrease could be attributed to limited access to medical services due to the pandemic and ongoing military actions.", National Cancer Registry of Ukraine ; breast cancer ; electronic health system ; new case of malignant neoplasm (MN) ,pandemic
Operating room efficiency of orthopedic surgery during the COVID-19 era.,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced operating rooms (ORs) to adopt new safety protocols. Although these measures protected the health of patients and providers, their impact on OR efficiency remains unclear. Our objective was to further elucidate the effects of COVID-19 on orthopedic surgery OR efficiency. This was a retrospective study of 14,856 orthopedic surgeries performed between December 1, 2019, and October 31, 2021. Institutional perioperative databases were used to identify relevant orthopedic surgeries. The onset of the COVID-19 period was set as March 12, 2020, when a state of emergency was declared in Tennessee. Both 90-day periods before and after this date were used for comparative analysis of the pre-COVID-19, peak-restrictions, and post-peak-restrictions time periods. Delay of first case start time and turnover time between cases were used as primary measures of efficiency. There were 1853 pre-COVID-19 cases, 1299 peak-restrictions cases, and 11,704 post-peak-restrictions cases analyzed. Delay of first case start time was found to be significantly different among the time periods (mean [SD] minutes, 7 [14] vs 8 [18] vs 7 [17], respectively; P < .001). Turnover time between cases was also significantly different among the time periods (62 [49] vs 66 [51] vs 64 [51]; P = .002). Although significant, there was minimal absolute change in orthopedic OR efficiency during the onset of the pandemic. These results suggest that the protocols enacted at our institution appropriately maintained orthopedic OR efficiency, even in the context of the rapidly increasing COVID-19 burden.",,pandemic
Therapists' perspectives on access to telemental health among Medicaid-enrolled youth.,"The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated risk for poor mental health (MH) outcomes among youth from low-income families and propelled a shift to telemental health. Yet, little is known about barriers to and facilitators of MH care access when services are delivered via synchronous telehealth to Medicaid-enrolled youth. Between December 2020 and March 2021, we conducted in-depth interviews with 19 therapists from a large safety-net organization who served Medicaid-enrolled youth (< 18 years of age) to elucidate their perspectives on barriers to and facilitators of access to telemental health services among this population. We conducted a thematic content analysis, guided by the 5 dimensions of health care access identified by Fortney and colleagues: geographical, temporal, digital, cultural (including acceptability of services), and financial access. Therapists noted that when components of digital access are met (ie, access to hardware and software, connectivity, and technological literacy), then telehealth could facilitate temporal access and eliminate geographic barriers; elimination of these barriers was particularly beneficial for youth in rural and hard-to-reach communities. Notably, many families depended on smartphones for telemental health access, and many youth depended on their caregiver's smartphone. When considering acceptability of services, some youth preferred in-person services, whereas other youth (especially some teenagers with high technological literacy) had a preference for telemental health. Our results highlight the need for flexibility in reimbursement policies that allows providers to optimize MH care access by offering telehealth delivered via telephone and video as well as in-person services, depending on the needs and preferences of youth and families.",,pandemic
Long-term health care costs following COVID-19: implications for pandemic preparedness.,"To estimate excess health care costs in the 12 months following COVID-19 diagnosis. Retrospective cohort study using Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island claims incurred from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2022, among commercial and Medicare Advantage members. Difference-in-differences analyses were used to compare changes in health care spend between the 12 months before (baseline period) and the 12 months after (post period) COVID-19 diagnosis for COVID-19 cases and contemporaneous matched controls without COVID-19. Overall, there were 7224 commercial and 1630 Medicare Advantage members with a COVID-19 diagnosis on/before March 31, 2021, each with a matched control, yielding a sample of 14,448 commercial and 3260 Medicare Advantage members. Among commercial members, 51.9% were aged 25 to 54 years and 54.0% were female. Among Medicare Advantage members, 94.2% were 65 years or older and 62.0% were female. Among commercial members, from the baseline period to the post period, total health care spend increased $41.61 (7.7%) per member per month (PMPM) more among COVID-19 cases compared with their matched controls. Among Medicare Advantage members, the difference-in-differences was greater, with spend increasing $97.30 (13.1%) PMPM more among cases compared with controls. The difference-in-differences was greatest for outpatient and professional services (both populations) and prescription services (Medicare Advantage only). COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with excess health care spend PMPM over the subsequent 12 months, highlighting the importance of societal preparations to support individuals' long-term health care needs following COVID-19 and as a part of future pandemic preparedness.",,pandemic

Temporal Trends in Pediatric Acute Sinusitis Surrounding the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"We assessed patterns in the national incidence of pediatric acute sinusitis and associated complications surrounding the initial COVID-19 lockdown. Retrospective National Database review. The Pediatric Health Information System. Acute sinusitis and associated complication incidence data from 2015 to 2022 were queried. Three time periods of T1, T2, and T3 were defined as: pre-COVID-19 baseline, initial pandemic, and postpandemic. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon rank sum tests, multivariable logistic regressions, and autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) to assess differences between the observed complication rates in T2 and T3 and the expected incidence rates in these time periods as estimated from T1 data. We identified 2535 acute sinusitis admissions across 42 centers. The incidence differed between T1 (31.5 cases/month), T2 (15.8 cases/month), and T3 (29 cases/month). Children aged 10 to 14 years had the highest acute sinusitis incidence rate (32.5%) compared to other ages in T2. At T1, acute sinusitis and associated complication rates followed parallel seasonal patterns. Although sinusitis incidence decreased during T2, complications increased significantly during T2 and T3 compared to T1 (37.4% and 39% vs 27.5%, P < .001). In the ARIMA model, the ratio of the observed to expected incidence (95% confidence interval) of complications was 1.09 (0.69, 2.60) in T2 and 1.14 (0.73, 2.62) in T3. We report the simultaneous decrease in acute sinusitis incidence and an increase in associated complications during and after the initial COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prepandemic baseline, reflecting changing patterns in viral infection due to the pandemic.",COVID-19;acute sinusitis;pediatric sinusitis;sinusitis complications,pandemic
Clinical Utility of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test in the Emergency Department.,"Rapid screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was important in the emergency department during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it requires several hours to provide results. Instead, the rapid antigen test (RAT) has a short turnaround time and can be used at the bedside but shows low sensitivity. To overcome these shortcomings, the clinical utility of stepwise testing of RAT with RT-PCR in the emergency department was analyzed. Patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RAT (SD Biosensor or Abbott) and RT-PCR (Seegene Allplex or GeneXpert) testing simultaneously at the emergency department in South Korea from January 2021 to March 2022 were enrolled. We compared the performance status of RAT with that of RT-PCR and evaluated the clinical utility of RAT as a screening tool for patients visiting the emergency department. A total of 7,574 patients were included. The overall prevalence of COVID-19 was 1.9% (146/7,574). The sensitivity and specificity of the RAT were 69.2% and 99.9%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 96.2% and 99.4%, respectively. Based on the cycle threshold (Ct) of the E gene, the sensitivity was 86.0% in patients with Ct < 26, but the sensitivity was 9.3% in patients with Ct ≥ 26. In the COVID-19 pandemic, RAT can be used as supplement test for the screening strategy using RT-PCR in the emergency department because it is rapid, highly specific, and relatively sensitive in patients with high viral load.",,pandemic
Antibody-mediated spike activation promotes cell-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2.,"The COVID pandemic fueled by emerging SARS-CoV-2 new variants of concern remains a major global health concern, and the constantly emerging mutations present challenges to current therapeutics. The spike glycoprotein is not only essential for the initial viral entry, but is also responsible for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 components via syncytia formation. Spike-mediated cell-cell transmission is strongly resistant to extracellular therapeutic and convalescent antibodies via an unknown mechanism. Here, we describe the antibody-mediated spike activation and syncytia formation on cells displaying the viral spike. We found that soluble antibodies against receptor binding motif (RBM) are capable of inducing the proteolytic processing of spike at both the S1/S2 and S2' cleavage sites, hence triggering ACE2-independent cell-cell fusion. Mechanistically, antibody-induced cell-cell fusion requires the shedding of S1 and exposure of the fusion peptide at the cell surface. By inhibiting S1/S2 proteolysis, we demonstrated that cell-cell fusion mediated by spike can be re-sensitized towards antibody neutralization in vitro. Lastly, we showed that cytopathic effect mediated by authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unaffected by the addition of extracellular neutralization antibodies. Hence, these results unveil a novel mode of antibody evasion and provide insights for antibody selection and drug design strategies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.",,pandemic
Initial response to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak in Sri Lanka; views of public health specialists through an International Health Regulations lens.,"The COVID-19 pandemic affected Sri Lanka despite having developed an International Health Regulations (IHR) steering committee in 2016 and a national action plan for health security following the Joint External Evaluation in 2018. Many steps were taken to improve the disaster management skills of healthcare workers even before the COVID-19 outbreak. We interviewed seven public health specialists to obtain their views on the country's response to the pandemic. A thematic analysis was conducted, leading to the emergence of three major themes and seven subthemes. The major themes included health security preparedness; COVID-19 management; and effects of COVID-19. The subthemes were; preparedness prior to pandemic and gaps in the preparedness (under health security preparedness); dual burden for the curative sector, strategies to reduce transmission and barriers to managing COVID-19 (under COVID-19 management) and negative and positive effects of COVID-19 (under effects of COVID-19). When COVID-19 reached Sri Lanka, healthcare workers, border control authorities and those involved with infectious disease control were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the pandemic. Healthcare workers' hesitation to work amidst the pandemic due to fear of infection and possible transmission of infection to their families was a major issue; the demand for personal protective equipment by health workers when stocks were low was also a contributory factor. Lockdowns with curfew and quarantine at government regulated centers were implemented as necessary. Perceptions of the public including permitting healthcare workers to perform field public health services, logistical barriers and lack of human resources were a few of the barriers that were expressed. Some persons did not declare their symptoms, fearing that they would have to be quarantined. The pandemic severely affected the economy and Sri Lanka relied on donations and loans to overcome the situation. Pandemic also brought about innovative methods to maintain and upgrade health service provision. Individuals with non-communicable diseases received their regular medications through the post which reduced their risk of being infected by visiting hospitals. Improvement of laboratory services and quarantine services, a reduction of acute respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases, improved intersectoral coordination and public philanthropic response were other positive effects.",,pandemic

"Publicity governance in contingency management during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: A ""Government-Society"" perspective.","Publicity is a common form of governance in government and is even more important in contingency management, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Publicity has two sides, the main body of publicity is led by the government, the object of publicity is the response to the public. So, publicity exists in the ""government-society"" field. Our aim was to find out how governments have been able to achieve effective publicity in the COVID-19 and to promote the active participation of society in governance. We adopted a case study approach. Taking Chongqing Municipality as an example, we collected 201 messages from five forms of publicity, including cell phone SMS, village (community) broadcast, publicity placards or banners, official websites, and government media platforms during the period of 2020-2021, and described and analyzed the publicity content of different forms of publicity. During the whole period of the COVID-19, the publicity governance under contingency management showed the characteristics of focusing on administrative efficiency, social efficiency and post-social efficiency, and showed specific publicity governance functions such as mobilization and control, education and clarification, cultivation of public consciousness and shaping government credibility. Publicity governance in contingency management during the COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes three effective approaches: time synchronization, organizational scale, and interaction among multiple advocacy agents. This can extend the existing government-centered research to the level of interaction between the government and society, and help the government to better use effective publicity to achieve the governance task under contingency management.",,pandemic
"A data-driven framework to assess population dynamics during novel coronavirus outbreaks: A case study on Xiamen Island, China.","The outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has profoundly influenced daily life, necessitating the understanding of the relationship between the epidemic's progression and population dynamics. In this study, we present a data-driven framework that integrates GIS-based data mining technology and a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model. This approach helps delineate population dynamics at the grid and community scales and analyze the impacts of government policies, urban functional areas, and intercity flows on population dynamics during the pandemic. Xiamen Island was selected as a case study to validate the effectiveness of the data-driven framework. The results of the high/low cluster analysis provide 99% certainty (P < 0.01) that the population distribution between January 23 and March 16, 2020, was not random, a phenomenon referred to as high-value clustering. The SEIR model predicts that a ten-day delay in implementing a lockdown policy during an epidemic can lead to a significant increase in the number of individuals infected by the virus. Throughout the epidemic prevention and control period (January 23 to February 21, 2020), residential and transportation areas housed more residents. After the resumption of regular activities, the population was mainly concentrated in residential, industrial, and transportation, as well as road facility areas. Notably, the migration patterns into and out of Xiamen were primarily centered on neighboring cities both before and after the outbreak. However, migration indices from cities outside the affected province drastically decreased and approached zero following the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings offer new insights into the interplay between the epidemic's development and population dynamics, which enhances the prevention and control of the coronavirus epidemic.",,pandemic
Increasing Hearing Readiness Using Boothless Audiometry.,"U.S. Army regulations require all soldiers to undergo annual audiometric testing to maintain hearing readiness. The standard method of monitoring hearing in the DoD is via multi-person testing in sound-treated booths using the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Hearing Conservation. COVID-19 significantly hindered the standard method, resulting in alarming declines in hearing readiness. In response, the Army Hearing Program initiated a pilot program to use boothless audiometers to supplement standard methods to increase hearing readiness. Funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was used to purchase 169 boothless audiometers and increase staffing at dozens of Army Hearing Program clinics. Standard operating procedures were established for audiometric testing outside the booth using a process matching standard test parameters (i.e., test frequencies, tone characteristics, and interstimulus intervals). Additional capabilities developed to leverage this new technology during the annual hearing exam include the administration of automated contralateral masking, enhanced tinnitus screening, and hearing health education and training. Monitoring audiometry using boothless audiometers has been conducted for nearly 12,000 service members worldwide. Thresholds obtained via boothless audiometers are comparable to follow-up thresholds obtained from the standard test methods in the booth (mean difference 95% CI, -1.2, 0.9), and hearing readiness has returned to pre-pandemic levels at installations where this novel technology is being used regularly. Significant reductions in patient encounters as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to innovative solutions leveraging boothless audiometers. While this has aided the primary mission to maintain a medically ready force, innovations from this endeavor highlight several additional improvements relative to current standards of care that should be considered for permanent inclusion in DoD Hearing Conservation Programs.",,pandemic
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Indicators of Psychological Health and Suicidal Ideation Within an Active Duty U.S. Military Population.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the psychological health of individuals. The pandemic has contributed to increased anxiety, elevated rates of depression, and worsening suicidal ideation among civilians. Reported rates of burnout are also elevated as employees and employers adapted to ever-changing work environments, finding it increasingly difficult to maintain a work-life balance. The objective of this study is to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the psychological health and rates of suicidal ideation of active duty military personnel in the USA. A total of 2055 military personnel and military-adjacent employees stationed at a U.S. Air Force base completed a self-report survey that was administered six times from January 2020 to December 2021. Validated scales assessed measures of psychological health and suicidal ideation. General Estimating Equations were used to examine how indicators of time and psychological health predicted suicidal ideation in a military population. Life satisfaction, happiness, feeling life is worthwhile, depression severity, and suicidal ideation did not statistically change across the six time points. Worry (P < .01) and depression (P < .001) did decrease significantly, while burnout (P = .01) significantly increased across these time points. Feeling life is worthwhile significantly predicted reduced suicidal ideation (B = -.19; SE = 0.05), while depression (B = 0.11; SE = 0.03), depression severity (B = 0.24; SE = 0.05), worry (B = 0.06; SE = 0.02), and burnout (B = 0.15; SE = 0.07) predicted increased suicidal ideation. The rates of depression and worry decreased throughout the pandemic for those in the study while rates of suicidal ideation remained constant, demonstrating the potential resilience of military personnel and military-adjacent employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, burnout increased and significantly predicted elevated rates of suicidal ideation, highlighting the importance of focusing on reducing workplace stressors for military personnel.",,pandemic
Opioid-Related Trends in Active Duty Service Members During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,"The USA is experiencing an opioid epidemic. Active duty service members (ADSMs) are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD). The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted health care and introduced additional stressors. The Military Healthcare System Data Repository was used to evaluate changes in diagnosis of OUD, medications for OUD (MOUD), opioid overdose (OD), and opioid rescue medication. ADSMs ages 18-45 years enrolled in the Military Healthcare System between February 2019 and April 2022 were included. Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software calculated the average monthly percent change over the study period, whereas Poisson regression compared outcomes over three COVID-19 periods: Pre-lockdown (pre-COVID-19 period 0) (February 2019-February 2020), early pandemic until ADSM vaccination initiation (COVID-19 period 1 [CP1]) (March 2020-November 2020), and late pandemic post-vaccination initiation (COVID-19 period 2 [CP2]) (December 2020-April 2022). A total of 1.86 million eligible ADSMs received care over the study period. Diagnoses of OUD decreased 1.4% monthly, MOUD decreased 0.6% monthly, diagnoses of opioid OD did not change, and opioid rescue medication increased 8.5% monthly.Diagnoses of OUD decreased in both COVID-19 time periods: CP1 and CP2: Rate ratio (RR) = 0.74 (95% CI, 0.68-0.79) and RR = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.67-0.76), respectively. MOUD decreased in both CP1 and CP2: RR = 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.88) and RR = 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78-0.96), respectively. Adjusted rates for diagnoses of opioid OD did not vary in either COVID-19 time period. Opioid rescue medication prescriptions increased in CP1 and CP2: RR = 1.09 (95% CI, 1.02-1.15) and RR = 6.02 (95% CI, 5.77-6.28), respectively. Rates of OUD and MOUD decreased, whereas rates of opioid rescue medication increased during the study period. Opioid OD rates did not significantly change in this study. Changes in the DoD policy may be affecting rates with greater effect than COVID-19 pandemic effects.",,pandemic
"Irritation, General and Pandemic-related Demands and the Importance of Workplace Health Promotion in Long-term Care - Results from the a Survey of Managers in Outpatient and Inpatient Long-term Care Facilities in Germany.","This study examines the association between irritation and demands of long-term care managers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role of workplace health promotion (WHP). Findings were derived from an online survey investigating long-term care managers as part of the employees in the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 207). Data analyses were performed with linear regression and interaction analyses. For managers in long-term care there was found a significant positive association between pandemic-related and general demands and irritation. The irritation level was significantly lower among managers in facilities where WHP was offered whereas the association between irritation and demands did not significantly vary by WHP. The presence of WHP was associated with lower average irritation levels among managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the implementation of WHP can contribute to maintain the well-being of long-term care managers.",,pandemic
SARS-CoV-2 and the DNA damage response.,"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is characterized by respiratory distress, multiorgan dysfunction and, in some cases, death. The virus is also responsible for post-COVID-19 condition (commonly referred to as 'long COVID'). SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 30 kb, which encodes 26 proteins. It has been reported to affect multiple pathways in infected cells, resulting, in many cases, in the induction of a 'cytokine storm' and cellular senescence. Perhaps because it is an RNA virus, replicating largely in the cytoplasm, the effect of SARS-Cov-2 on genome stability and DNA damage responses (DDRs) has received relatively little attention. However, it is now becoming clear that the virus causes damage to cellular DNA, as shown by the presence of micronuclei, DNA repair foci and increased comet tails in infected cells. This review considers recent evidence indicating how SARS-CoV-2 causes genome instability, deregulates the cell cycle and targets specific components of DDR pathways. The significance of the virus's ability to cause cellular senescence is also considered, as are the implications of genome instability for patients suffering from long COVID.",COVID-19;DNA damage response;DNA repair;SARS-CoV-2;senescence,pandemic
Mutational antigenic landscape of prevailing H9N2 influenza virus hemagglutinin spectrum.,"H9N2 influenza viruses are globally endemic in birds, and a sharp increase in human infections with H9N2 occurred during 2021 to 2022. In this study, we assess the antigenic and pathogenic impact of 23 hemagglutinin (HA) amino acid mutations. Our study reveals that three specific mutations, labeled R164Q, N166D, and I220T, are responsible for the binding of antibodies with escape mutations. Variants containing R164Q and I220T mutations increase viral replication in avian and mammalian cells. Furthermore, T150A and I220T mutations are found to enhance viral replication in mice, indicating that these mutations may have the potential to adapt mammals. Structure analysis reveals that residues 164 and 220 bearing R164Q and I220T mutations increase interactions with the surrounding residues. Our findings enrich current knowledge about the risk assessment regarding which predominant HA immune-escape mutations of H9N2 viruses may pose the greatest threat to the emergence of pandemics in birds and humans.",CP: Microbiology;H9N2;antigenicity;avian influenza virus;hemagglutinin;immune-escape mutation;pathogenicity,pandemic
Future Prediction of Close Contacts in IoT-based Contact Tracing System using a New Real-Life Dataset.,"Contact tracing is an effective method for mitigating the infectious diseases spread and it played a crucial role in reducing COVID-19 outbreak. Since the pandemic, there has been an increased concern regarding people's health in hospital and office settings, as these limited air exchange spaces provide a conductive medium for virus spread. Various technologies were used to recognize close contacts autonomously, in addition, multiple machine learning attempts were carried out to determine proximity in contact tracing. This study, however, proposes a unique concept in contact tracing: forecasting future close contact prior to occurrence in order to regulate and control it rather than tracking past occurrences. For our research, we constructed a completely new real-life dataset that was collected during the pandemic in a hospital infectious ward (Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia) utilizing a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Internet of Things (IoT) system. Our prediction technique considers two types of environments: single transceiver environments and multiple transceivers settings, these transceivers record the nearby tags' BLE received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values. The system employs mathematical models and supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms to solve regression and classification problems for workers' pattern recognition within the environment. The output is compared using different metrics, such as efficiency, which reached more than 80%, root mean square errors and mean absolute errors which were as low as 2.4 and 1.2 respectively in some models.",,pandemic

Nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Mortality During Unique COVID-19 Epidemic Waves.,"Quantifying the burden of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated mortality is necessary to assess the need for infection prevention and control measures. To investigate the occurrence of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated 30-day mortality among patients admitted to hospitals in Region Stockholm, Sweden. A retrospective, matched cohort study divided the period from March 1, 2020, until September 15, 2022, into a prevaccination period, early vaccination and pre-Omicron (period 1), and late vaccination and Omicron (period 2). From among 303 898 patients 18 years or older living in Region Stockholm, 538 951 hospital admissions across all hospitals were included. Hospitalized admissions with nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections were matched to as many as 5 hospitalized admissions without nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 by age, sex, length of stay, admission time, and hospital unit. Nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection defined as the first positive polymerase chain reaction test result at least 8 days after hospital admission or within 2 days after discharge. Primary outcome of 30-day mortality was analyzed using time-to-event analyses with a Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for age, sex, educational level, and comorbidities. Among 2193 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections or reinfections (1107 women [50.5%]; median age, 80 [IQR, 71-87] years), 2203 nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified. The incidence rate of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.51-1.64) per 1000 patient-days. In the matched cohort, 1487 hospital admissions with nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections were matched to 5044 hospital admissions without nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections. Thirty-day mortality was higher in the prevaccination period (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.97 [95% CI, 2.50-3.53]) compared with period 1 (AHR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.50-2.88]) or period 2 (AHR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.92-1.60]). Among patients with nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections, 30-day AHR comparing those with 2 or more doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and those with less than 2 doses was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46-0.88). In this matched cohort study, nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections were associated with higher 30-day mortality during the early phases of the pandemic and lower mortality during the Omicron variant wave and after the introduction of vaccinations. Mitigation of excess mortality risk from nosocomial transmission should be a strong focus when population immunity is low through implementation of adequate infection prevention and control measures.",,pandemic
"Social Networks, the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Mental Health: Resiliency Through Social Bonding and Cohesion.","Objectives. To assess how personal social network characteristics moderated mental health declines during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adults compared with other age groups. Methods. The Person to Person Health Interview Study, a representative, probability-based cohort study (n = 2485) collected data through face-to-face (baseline) and phone (follow-up) interviews before and during the pandemic. We used survey-weighted growth curve models to examine network effects on computer-adaptive testing measures of depression and anxiety severity. Results. Respondents reported significantly increased depression and anxiety in 2021, which returned almost to baseline levels for most age groups by 2022 (P < .001). Stronger ties to others and more interconnected ties were significantly associated with lower depression (B = -0.112 [P < .05]; B = -0.086 [P < .001]) and anxiety (B = -0.101 [P < .05]; B = -0.063 [P < .01]) severity across the pandemic. Interaction models revealed disproportionate protective effects of network characteristics on depression (B = -0.456 [P < .001]; B = -0.268 [P < .001]) and anxiety (B = -0.388 [P < .001]; B = -0.284 [P < .001]) for emerging adults. Conclusions. Cohesive and affectively strong personal networks promote resiliency to common mental health challenges during periods of crisis, particularly for emerging adults whose social roles and relationships were disrupted during a critical period of development.

"Contributors to Second-Degree Accelerated Student Success During the COVID-19 Pandemic as Perceived by Administrators, Directors, and Faculty: A Qualitative Descriptive Study.","This qualitative descriptive study explored the contributors to second-degree accelerated program (SDAP) student success during COVID-19 as described by SDAP administrators, directors, and faculty. SDAPs are fast, rigorous, and stressful. Understanding how SDAP students remain successful, despite their challenges and stressors, during the disorder of a global pandemic could provide insight for administrators, directors, and faculty on how to facilitate success in SDAP students in the future. A qualitative descriptive approach was used in this study. Personal interviews and a demographic survey were used for data collection. Fourteen SDAP administrators, directors, and faculty participated. Six themes emerged: engagement, clinical experiences, student characteristics, relationships, flexibility, and faculty concerns. Participants shared several recommendations to guide other SDAP administrators, directors, and faculty in developing robust SDAPs and successful students.",,pandemic
Autonomic Manifestations of Long-COVID Syndrome.,"Long-COVID is a novel condition emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-COVID is characterized by symptoms commonly seen in autonomic disorders including fatigue, brain fog, light-headedness, and palpitations. This article will critically evaluate recent findings and studies on Long-COVID and its physiological autonomic manifestations. Studies have reported on the prevalence of different symptoms and autonomic disorders in Long-COVID cohorts. Autonomic nervous system function, including both the parasympathetic and sympathetic limbs, has been studied using different testing techniques in Long-COVID patients. While numerous mechanisms may contribute to Long-COVID autonomic pathophysiology, it is currently unclear which ones lead to a Long-COVID presentation. To date, studies have not tested treatment options for autonomic disorders in Long-COVID patients. Long-COVID is associated with autonomic abnormalities. There is a high prevalence of clinical autonomic disorders among Long-COVID patients, with limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of treatment options.",Autonomic dysfunction;Heart rate variability;Initial orthostatic hypotension;Long-COVID syndrome;Orthostatic hypotension;Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,pandemic
"COVID-19 Vaccination Messengers, Communication Channels, and Messages Trusted Among Black Communities in the USA: a Review.","Black and African American adults exhibited higher levels of mistrust and vaccine hesitancy and lower levels of vaccination throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination and booster uptake remains disproportionately low among Black adults. We conducted a systematic review of empirical research published between February 2021 and July 2022 from five electronic databases and the grey literature. We screened studies that assessed COVID-19 vaccination information needs and preferences as well as communication strategies among Black adults in the USA. We extracted data, then analyzed and synthesized results narratively. Twenty-two articles were included: 2 interventions, 3 experimental surveys, 7 observational surveys, 8 qualitative inquiries, and 2 mixed methods studies. Studies reported credible and preferred COVID-19 vaccination information sources/messengers, channels, and content. Commonly trusted messengers included personal health care providers, social network connections, and church/faith leaders. Electronic outreach (e.g., email, text messages), community events (e.g., forums, canvassing), and social media were popular. Black communities wanted hopeful, fact-based messages that address racism and mistrust; persuasive messages using collective appeals about protecting others may be more influential in changing behavior. Future communication strategies aiming to increase vaccine confidence and encourage COVID-19 booster vaccination among Black communities should be developed in partnership with community leaders and local health care providers to disseminate trauma-informed messages with transparent facts and collective action appeals across multiple in-person and electronic channels.",COVID-19 vaccination;Communication inequalities;Health communication;Systematic review;Vaccine hesitancy,pandemic
Variation in parental experiences with their child's hospitalization over the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Hospitals and healthcare workers have been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The potential impacts upon the patient experience have been less documented, particularly in the pediatric setting. Our aim was to examine how parental experiences with their child's hospitalization varied during the COVID-19 pandemic at two children's hospitals in Alberta, Canada. A random sample of parents were surveyed within six weeks of their child's discharge from Alberta's two children's hospitals. Surveys were administered using the Alberta Pediatric Inpatient Experiences Survey (APIES) - a validated instrument used to assess parental experiences during their child's hospitalization. Surveys were linked with administrative inpatient records. Three cohorts were created based on hospital discharge date: Pre-COVID (Pre: April 2019 to March 2020), COVID year one (C1: April 2020 to March 2021), and COVID year two (C2: April 2021 to March 2022). We examined 48 survey questions, including four overall rating scales. Survey responses were Likert scales. These were transformed to normalized scores from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Differences between cohorts were assessed using ANOVA and the post-hoc Tukey test. A total of 3,611 surveys (1,314 Pre; 997 C1; 1,300 C2) were completed over the three-year period. Five questions showed differences between the Pre and C1 periods, six showed differences between Pre and C2, and 13 showed differences between C1 and C2. Among these questions, scores pre-COVID were lower than COVID year one, while results in COVID year two were lower than pre-COVID and COVID year one. Thirty-one survey questions showed no statistical differences between the three time periods. For the overall ratings, only hospital rating showed a difference in any of the periods (91.4 C1 vs. 90.2 C2). Overall ratings of doctors, nurses, and recommendation of the hospital to others showed no differences. This study showed that the experiences of parents during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic were mildly better or comparable to historical results. This changed over the following year, where lower scores were reported on 13 questions.",COVID-19;Hospitalization;PREM;Patient experience;Pediatrics;Survey,pandemic
Outcome of COVID-19 patients treated with VV-ECMO in Tyrol during the pandemic.,"A small percentage of patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV‑2) showed severe respiratory deterioration requiring treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). During the pandemic surges availability of ECMO devices was limited and resources had to be used wisely. The aim of this analysis was to determine the incidence and outcome of venovenous (VV) ECMO patients in Tyrol, when criteria based on the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) guidelines for VV-ECMO initiation were established. This is a secondary analysis of the Tyrol-CoV-ICU-Reg, which includes all patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Tyrol. Of the 13 participating departments, VV-ECMO was performed at 4 units at the University Hospital Innsbruck. Overall, 37 (3.4%) of 1101 patients were treated with VV-ECMO during their ICU stay. The hospital mortality rate was approximately 40% (n = 15). Multiorgan failure due to sepsis was the most common cause of death. No significant difference in survival rates between newly initiated and experienced centers was observed. The median survival time of nonsurvivors was 27 days (interquartile range, IQR: 22-36 days) after initiation of VV-ECMO. Acute kidney injury meeting the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria occurred in 48.6%. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was initiated in 12 (32.4%) patients after a median of 18 days (IQR: 1-26 days) after VV-ECMO start. The median length of ICU and hospital stays were 38 days (IQR: 30-55 days) and 50 days (IQR: 37-83 days), respectively. Despite a rapidly increased demand and the resulting requirement to initiate an additional ECMO center, we could demonstrate that a structured approach with interdisciplinary collaboration resulted in favorable survival rates similar to multinational reports.",Age;Complications;Experienced center;Newly initiated center;RRT delay,pandemic
"Prevalence and adverse effects of sport-related nutritional supplements (sport drinks, bars, and gels) in the military before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: the US Military Dietary Supplement Use Study.","Sport-related nutritional supplements (SRNS) include sport drinks, sport bars, and sport gels. This investigation examined temporal patterns in SRNS use and adverse effects (AEs) reported by a single cohort of United States active-duty service members (SMs) surveyed before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A stratified random sample (n = 22,858) of SMs (Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps) who completed a questionnaire on their SRNS use and AE experiences and were still on active duty were asked to complete the identical questionnaire on a second occasion. Twenty-five percent of successfully contacted SMs completed both questionnaires (n = 5,778) and were included in this investigation. The average ± standard deviation time between questionnaires was 1.3 ± 0.2 years. Prevalence of reported SRNS use ≥1 time/week in the baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) phases were as follows: any SRNS: BL = 46%, FU = 41%; sport drinks: BL = 31%, FU = 28%; sport bars: BL = 30%, FU = 24%; sport gels: BL = 4%, FU = 4%. Reported weekly aerobic and resistance training durations were reduced in the FU period (8% and 26%, respectively). The proportion of SMs reporting SRNS use in both study phases was as follows: any SRNS = 62%, sport drinks = 54%, sport bars = 50%, sport gels = 35%. Prevalence of reported AEs in the BL and FU phases were as follows: any SRNS: BL = 1.9%, FU = 1.9%; sport drinks: BL = 1.0%, FU = 1.3%; sport bars: BL = 1.7%, FU = 1.4%; sport gels: BL = 3.3%, FU = 2.5%. The proportion of SMs reporting AEs in both phases was as follows: any SRNS = 14%, sport drinks = 11%, sport bars = 17%, sport gels = 0%. Overall SRNS use prevalence decreased slightly in the FU period, possibly because of reduced physical training related to military restrictions imposed during the emergence of COVID-19 between surveys. A large proportion of SMs reported changing their use patterns in the FU with some discontinuing use and others initiating use. The AE incidence was similarly low in the BL and FU phases, and few SMs reported AEs in both phases suggesting AEs were transitory. AE reporting for SRNSs was much lower than previously found for dietary supplements, possibly because of greater government regulatory control over SRNSs.",Nutrition;age;body mass index;dietary supplements;gender;physical activity,pandemic
[Inpatient surgical treatment in mass casualty situations and disasters-Current treatment capacities depending on alarm status of the hospital and treatment concept].,"The functionality and treatment capacity of hospitals are decisive components to safeguard the in-hospital treatment of patients in crises and catastrophes. This is shown by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The aim of this study is the elicitation of treatment capacities of hospitals in the trauma network of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) assuming a damage situation with a multitude of trauma patients needing treatment. The 622 hospitals in the trauma network were surveyed to elicit the current treatment capacities depending on the principles and standards of treatment. For this purpose, a questionnaire for voluntary participation in the survey was placed online via the Academy of Trauma Surgery (AUC) of the DGU and an electronic platform (SurveyMonkey). The data presented in this article represent an extract of the total data focussed on the issues involved in the study. A total of 252 of the 622 hospitals certified in December 2022 (40%) participated in the survey and 250 datasets could be utilized. Local, regional and supraregional trauma centers were equally represented. Using a tactical abbreviated surgical control (TASC) focussed on survival, the treatment capacities in the individual triage categories could be increased with respect to the scenarios in question. It was also clear that the availability of teams skilled in the surgical treatment of body cavity injuries still represents a challenge. The results of the survey demonstrate the extent to which treatment capacities for the care of injured and wounded patients are currently available in the hospitals of the DGU trauma network and to what extent they can be increased. In this way, due the dynamics a mass casualty incident can initially lead locally and temporarily to a decompensated crisis management. The aim of all efforts and preparations must therefore be to durably strengthen hospitals so that this can be avoided as reliably as possible and to include these considerations in the hospital structural reform.",Body cavity injuries;Certification;Compensated crisis care;Healthcare system;Trauma centers,pandemic
Interventions reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review of randomized evidence.,"COVID-19 pandemic changed the way medical research is published, possibly forever. As the need for rapidity led to the rise of preprint servers, the undeniable drop in the overall quality of scientific publications requires an in-depth review of all available evidence. The present manuscript aims to identify and summarize all treatments which have been reported to reduce mortality in randomized trials in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Independent investigators searched MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases to identify all randomized trials of any intervention influencing mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients up to August 18th, 2022. Articles were selected only when they fulfilled all the following: randomized trial design; dealing with any kind of interventions in adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients; and statistically significant reduction in mortality. We identified 28 interventions (42 manuscripts) reducing mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. About 60% of the studies (26/42) were multicentric, for a total of 1140 centers involved worldwide. Several of these studies were published in high-ranked, peer-reviewed journals. Interventions with randomized evidence of mortality reduction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients belonged to 5 domains: corticosteroids, immunomodulators, antimicrobials, supportive therapies, and other drugs. Many interventions have the potential to reduce mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The correct treatment of future pandemics relies on large, multicentric randomized clinical trials for further evaluation of these promising strategies.",,pandemic
Female Leadership during COVID-19: The Effectiveness of Diverse Approaches towards Mitigation Management during a Pandemic.,"This paper tackles the question of how female leaders at national levels of government managed COVID-19 response and recovery from the first COVID-19 case in their respective countries through to 30 September 2021. The aim of this study was to determine which COVID-19 mitigations were effective in lowering the viral reproduction rate and number of new cases (per million) in each of the fourteen female presidents' countries-Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bolivia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, Serbia, and Taiwan. We first compared these countries by finding a mean case rate (29,420 per million), mean death rate (294 per million), and mean excess mortality rate (+1640 per million). We then analyzed the following mitigation measures per country: school closing, workplace closing, canceling public events, restrictions on gatherings, closing public transport, stay-at-home requirements, restrictions on internal movement, international travel controls, income support, debt/contract relief, fiscal measures, international support, public information campaigns, testing policy, contact tracing, emergency investment in healthcare, investment in vaccines, facial coverings, vaccination policy, and protection of the elderly. We utilized the random forest approach to examine the predictive significance of these variables, providing more interpretability. Subsequently, we then applied the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistical test to see the differences with and without mitigation in effect for the variables that were found to be significant by the random forest model. We observed that different mitigation strategies varied in their effectiveness. Notably, restrictions on internal movement and the closure of public transportation proved to be highly effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Embracing qualities such as community-based, empathetic, and personable leadership can foster greater trust among citizens, ensuring continued adherence to governmental policies like mask mandates and stay-at-home orders, ultimately enhancing long-term crisis management.",COVID-19;female presidents;gender differences;leadership;mitigation,pandemic
From Threatening Chaos to Temporary Order through a Complex Process of Adaptation: A Grounded Theory Study of the Escalation of Intensive Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"To ensure high-quality care, operationalize resilience and fill the knowledge gap regarding how to improve the prerequisites for resilient performance, it is necessary to understand how adaptive capacity unfolds in practice. The main aim of this research was to explain the escalation process of intensive care during the first wave of the pandemic from a microlevel perspective, including expressions of resilient performance, intervening conditions at the micro-meso-macrolevels and short- and long-term consequences. A secondary aim was to provide recommendations regarding how to optimize the prerequisites for resilient performance in intensive care. A grounded theory methodology was used. First-person stories from different healthcare professionals (n70) in two Swedish regions were analyzed using the constant comparative method. This resulted in a novel conceptual model (including 6 main categories and 24 subcategories), and 41 recommendations. The conclusion of these findings is that the escalation of intensive care can be conceptualized as a transition from threatening chaos to temporary order through a complex process of adaptation. To prepare for the future, the components of space, stuff, staff, system and science, with associated continuity plans, must be implemented, anchored and communicated to actors at all levels of the system.",COVID-19;adaptive capacity;grounded theory;healthcare;intensive care;resilience;resilient performance;surge response;unexpected crises,pandemic
"How Much Did Urban Park Use Change under the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Comparative Study of Summertime Park Use in 2019 and 2020 in Edinburgh, Scotland.","The importance of urban parks was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when a number of restrictions on social gatherings were in place and people's movements were often restricted to their local neighbourhood. This study examined the changes in patterns of park use before and during COVID-19 to understand how the pandemic influenced such use. The methods involved behaviour observation and mapping, to offer a comparison of the use of parks in Edinburgh, Scotland, before and in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings show an overall increase in use of urban parks during COVID-19, as expected, with significantly higher use in social areas, sports and fitness areas, and playground areas. However, while there was an overall increase in people visiting parks with others during COVID, in woodland areas there was an increase in lone visitors. This study shows the importance of parks for socialisation, exercise and children's play, but also for spending time alone in natural areas during COVID-19. The value of urban parks at a time of social disruption, such as the pandemic, is highlighted, and their role in supporting a variety of urban dwellers' needs points to priorities for future park planning, design and management.",COVID-19;behaviour observation;change over time;lockdown;park usage;urban parks,pandemic
"Public Health Policy, Political Ideology, and Public Emotion Related to COVID-19 in the U.S.","Social networks, particularly Twitter 9.0 (known as X as of 23 July 2023), have provided an avenue for prompt interactions and sharing public health-related concerns and emotions, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person communication became less feasible due to stay-at-home policies in the United States (U.S.). The study of public emotions extracted from social network data has garnered increasing attention among scholars due to its significant predictive value for public behaviors and opinions. However, few studies have explored the associations between public health policies, local political ideology, and the spatial-temporal trends of emotions extracted from social networks. This study aims to investigate (1) the spatial-temporal clustering trends (or spillover effects) of negative emotions related to COVID-19; and (2) the association relationships between public health policies such as stay-at-home policies, political ideology, and the negative emotions related to COVID-19. This study employs multiple statistical methods (zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression, random-effects model, and spatial autoregression (SAR) model) to examine relationships at the county level by using the data merged from multiple sources, mainly including Twitter 9.0, Johns Hopkins, and the U.S. Census Bureau. We find that negative emotions related to COVID-19 extracted from Twitter 9.0 exhibit spillover effects, with counties implementing stay-at-home policies or leaning predominantly Democratic showing higher levels of observed negative emotions related to COVID-19. These findings highlight the impact of public health policies and political polarization on spatial-temporal public emotions exhibited in social media. Scholars and policymakers can benefit from understanding how public policies and political ideology impact public emotions to inform and enhance their communication strategies and intervention design during public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19;Twitter;public health;public health policy;social media,pandemic
Survey on the Mental Health of Dispensing Pharmacists in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Region (France).,"The COVID-19 pandemic intensely involved pharmacists in France, with new responsibilities on a large scale, introducing to dispensary practice the performance of vaccination and nasopharyngeal swabs. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of burnout, anxiety, and depression in pharmacists after the COVID-19 health crisis and to identify factors associated with psychological distress. A cross-sectional observational study involved 1700 pharmacies in an entire French region. Sociodemographic, geographical, and medical information (burnout tested with the MBI and anxiety/depression measured on the HAD scale) were collected via an online anonymous self-administered questionnaire. The characteristics of the pharmacy and the practice of antigen testing and vaccination were requested. Quantitative and qualitative variables associated with psychological distress were investigated with a factor analysis. In total, 360 responses were collected (20.5%). Of the responses, 41.9% showed definite anxiety symptoms and 18.3% showed proven depressive symptoms. Three clusters were described according to the intensity of burnout experience, depersonalization, and loss of personal accomplishment. The analysis identified that one cluster was at high risk of burnout (high burnout and depersonalization scores). Of these stressed, exhausted pharmacists, 69.3% showed definite anxiety, 37.9% showed proven depression, and in smaller pharmacies. The carrying out of antigenic testing and anti-COVID vaccination, as well as the geographical location of the pharmacy, were not discriminating factors in these three groups. Mental health care and suicide prevention should be provided to at-risk pharmacists. It seems essential to publicize the range of resources available to support pharmacists.",anxiety;burnout;depression;mental health;pharmacists,pandemic
"Association of Social Vulnerability and COVID-19 Mortality Rates in Texas between 15 March 2020, and 21 July 2022: An Ecological Analysis.","Despite the key role of social vulnerability such as economic disadvantage in health outcomes, research is limited on the impact of social vulnerabilities on COVID-19-related deaths, especially at the state and county level in the USA. We conducted a cross-sectional ecologic analysis of COVID-19 mortality by the county-level Minority Health Social Vulnerability Index (MH SVI) and each of its components in Texas. Negative binomial regression (NBR) analyses were used to estimate the association between the composite MH SVI (and its components) and COVID-19 mortality. A 0.1-unit increase in the overall MH SVI (IRR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.55; p = 0.017) was associated with a 27% increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate. Among the MH SVI component measures, only low socioeconomic status (IRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.28-1.89; p = 0.001) and higher household composition (e.g., proportion of older population per county) and disability scores (IRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.29-1.68; p < 0.001) were positively associated with COVID-19 mortality rates. This study provides further evidence of disparities in COVID-19 mortality by social vulnerability and can inform decisions on the allocation of social resources and services as a strategy for reducing COVID-19 mortality rates and similar pandemics in the future.",COVID-19;Coronavirus 2019;MH SVI;SARS-CoV-2;SVI;minority health;pandemics,pandemic
The Role of Self-Compassion and Attributions in the Mental Health of Older Adolescents amid the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"This study aimed to examine the relationship among self-compassion, attributional styles, and mental health and their components in older adolescents in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The role of each component of self-compassion (self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification) and attributions (globality, stability, self-worth, and negative consequences) in predicting mental health was also analyzed. There were 322 participants aged 18 to 22 that participated in an online survey. The participants filled out a form that consisted of sociodemographic questions, COVID-19-related questions, the Self-Compassion Scale, the Mental Health Continuum-short form-and the Cognitive Styles Questionnaire-very short form. The results indicated moderate levels of self-compassion, attributions, and mental health in participants. Furthermore, gender differences in self-compassion were confirmed, meaning that male participants had higher total levels of self-compassion, and certain differences were observed on attribution subscales, but not on well-being subscales. Self-compassion and mental health were found to be positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with negative attributions. Of the four attributional components, stability and negative consequences were revealed to be significant negative predictors in the first step but lost their significance with the inclusion of self-compassion components in the second step of the analysis. Regarding the six components of self-compassion, self-kindness, recoded isolation, and common humanity were significant positive predictors in the second step of the analysis. COVID-19-related items did not show any significant intergroup differences. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between positive mental health, self-compassion, and attributions in older adolescents so that they can be used as theoretical support for related interventions, especially during and after times of crisis, such as a pandemic.",COVID-19 pandemic;attributional styles;mental health;older adolescents;self-compassion,pandemic
The Perception of the Quality of Professional Healthcare Assistance for the Management of Endometriosis: Findings from a National Survey in Italy.,"(1) Background: endometriosis is included in the list of chronic and disabling pathologies. This study aimed to examine patients' points of view about the quality of care for endometriosis during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Methods: we conducted a survey on knowledge about endometriosis, management of endometriosis, perceived mental and physical well-being, and perceived changes in the quality of care during the pandemic; (3) Results: out of 1065 participants, 875 were included in the analysis, with an average age of 34. Overall, patients had positive perceptions of care accessibility and cleanliness (95%), but less satisfaction with visit hours (86%). Those with better physical and psychological health were more satisfied with service hours, while those treated at specialised centres were more content with cleanliness. Satisfaction with clarity was linked to specialist treatment, and perceived availability to listen correlated with age, complications, and overall health status; (4) Conclusions: patients' perspectives are crucial for patient education and advocate for specialised interdisciplinary networks to support endometriosis management and patients' well-being. These findings highlight the importance of considering patient viewpoints, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on healthcare systems and suggest a need for further research from the patient's perspective.",endometriosis;patient satisfaction;patient’s healthcare quality perception;quality of care (QoC) satisfaction,pandemic
Discovery of Nirmatrelvir Resistance Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro: A Computational-Experimental Approach.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the urgency for effective antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Targeting the main protease (3CLpro) of the virus has emerged as a promising approach, and nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), the active component of Pfizer's oral drug Paxlovid, has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy. However, the emergence of resistance mutations poses a challenge to its continued success. In this study, we employed alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) alanine scanning to identify nirmatrelvir-resistance mutations within SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. FEP identified several mutations, which were validated through in vitro IC50 experiments and found to result in 8- and 72-fold increases in nirmatrelvir IC50 values. Additionally, we constructed SARS-CoV-2 omicron replicons containing these mutations, and one of the mutants (S144A/E166A) displayed a 20-fold increase in EC50, confirming the role of FEP in identifying drug-resistance mutations. Our findings suggest that FEP can be a valuable tool in proactively monitoring the emergence of resistant strains and guiding the design of future inhibitors with reduced susceptibility to drug resistance. As nirmatrelvir is currently widely used for treating COVID-19, this research has important implications for surveillance efforts and antiviral development.",,pandemic
Genotyping and traceability analysis of norovirus in Yantai between 2017 and 2019.,"To investigate the diversity and evolution of noroviruses in Yantai in recent years, this study focused on the coat protein regions of norovirus-positive samples with nucleic acid detection (cycle threshold) values below 30 between 2017 and 2019. A total of 81 sequences were obtained for genotyping. Initially, a high-throughput sequencing approach was established to perform the whole-genome sequencing of multiple typical diarrheal strains. Using bioinformatics software such as BEAST, recombinant variant analysis was performed for each genotype of the norovirus strains, and genetic evolutionary analysis was conducted for the dominant strain GII.4, as well as the rare variant GII.21. The results showed that there were multiple genotypes such as GI.3, GI.6, GI.7, GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, GII.4, GII.6, GII.13, GII.17, GII.21, and GIX.1 in the positive samples of norovirus from 2017 to 2019. GII.4 is characterized by diverse genotypes, with new changes in antigenic epitopes occurring during the course of the epidemic. This may have led to the emergence of a new pandemic. This suggests a need to strengthen surveillance. The results of this study suggest that attention should be paid to the predominant genotypes prevalent in neighboring countries and regions, and the safety supervision of imported food should be strengthened to aid in the prevention and control of related viruses.",epidemic characterization;molecular evolution;norovirus;surveillance;traceability,pandemic
COVID-19-associated liver injury: Adding fuel to the flame.,"COVID-19 is mainly characterized by respiratory disorders and progresses to multiple organ involvement in severe cases. With expansion of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 research, correlative liver injury has been revealed. It is speculated that COVID-19 patients exhibited abnormal liver function, as previously observed in the SARS and MERS pandemics. Furthermore, patients with underlying diseases such as chronic liver disease are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and indicate a poor prognosis accompanied by respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammation, or metabolic diseases. Therefore, COVID-19 has the potential to impair liver function, while individuals with preexisting liver disease suffer from much worse infected conditions. COVID-19 related liver injury may be owing to direct cytopathic effect, immune dysfunction, gut-liver axis interaction, and inappropriate medication use. However, discussions on these issues are infancy. Expanding research have revealed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression mediated the combination of virus and target cells, iron metabolism participated in the virus life cycle and the fate of target cells, and amino acid metabolism regulated immune response in the host cells, which are all closely related to liver health. Further exploration holds great significance in elucidating the pathogenesis, facilitating drug development, and advancing clinical treatment of COVID-19-related liver injury. This article provides a review of the clinical and laboratory hepatic characteristics in COVID-19 patients, describes the etiology and impact of liver injury, and discusses potential pathophysiological mechanisms.",ACE2;COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2;cytokine storm;gut−liver axis;liver injury,pandemic
Clinical manifestations and outcomes associated with PICU admission in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Taiwan: A retrospective cohort study.,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare and serious systemic inflammatory disorder that occurs following a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study aims to investigate the clinical manifestations, risk factors associated with pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, and outcome among children with MIS-C in Taiwan. A retrospective analysis was conducted among pediatric patients diagnosed with MIS-C between June 2022 and February 2023 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan. Data on demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment modalities, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Twenty-eight MIS-C patients, including 9 boys and 19 girls, with an average age of 5.3 ± 3.8 years old, were enrolled. Most of the cases (78.6%) were diagnosed following the first pandemic wave of COVID-19 in Taiwan. The leading clinical manifestations observed were fever (100%), skin rash (64.3%), tachycardia (46.4%), and vomiting (46.4%). Nine patients (32.1%) were admitted to the PICU due to hypotension or neurological manifestations. Higher levels of band-form white blood cells, procalcitonin, ferritin, d-dimer, prothrombin time, NT-proBNP, and lower platelet levels on arrival were associated with PICU admission (p = 3.9 × 10-2 ,9 × 10-3 , 4 × 10-3 ,1 × 10-3 , 5 × 10-3 , 4.1 × 10-2 , and 3.4 × 10-2 , respectively). Arrhythmia in one case (3.5%) and coronary artery abnormalities, including dilatation in two cases (7.1%) and small aneurysms in one case (3.5%) were identified. Regardless of ICU admission, no patients experienced systolic dysfunction or mortality following treatment. MIS-C cases in Taiwan have a favorable outcome. Although one-third of the patients required PICU admission, none of the MIS-C cases resulted in severe cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. This study provides valuable insights into the clinical manifestations and outcomes associated with PICU admission in children with MIS-C in Taiwan.",COVID-19;MIS-C;SARS-CoV-2;Taiwan;intensive care,pandemic
Duration and aetiology of extended hospitalization among COVID-19 patients in United Arab Emirates.,"A retrospective review of the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the challenges faced by hospitals is essential in the post-pandemic era of 2022. To identify the reasons for prolonged hospitalization after recovery for COVID-19 patients in the United Arab Emirates. This was a retrospective observational study of 150 (18.75%) patients with prolonged hospitalization in a tertiary hospital in Dubai from 1 April to 1 July 2020. Data was obtained from the electronic medical records of the hospital. Continuous variables are reported as mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages. The mean duration of hospitalization was 48.5 (9-272) days, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 22 days. The mean duration of extended stay was 27.5 (2-231) days, with an IQR of 17 days. The common reasons for prolonged hospitalization were mandatory isolation 28% (n = 62), hospital-acquired infections 17% (n = 37), acute respiratory distress syndrome 15% (n = 32), myopathy/neuropathy 14% (n = 31), pulmonary fibrosis requiring oxygen supplementation 14% (n = 31), and completion of COVID-19 treatment 12% (n = 25). To make optimal use of available hospital resources, reasons that directly or indirectly contributed to the prolonged hospitalization of patients should be considered and addressed during future pandemics or disease outbreaks.",COVID-19;Dubai;length of stay;long COVID;prolonged hospitalization,pandemic
Identifying beliefs driving COVID-19 vaccination: Lessons for effective messaging.,"Increasing vaccination acceptance has been essential during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for future public health emergencies. This study aimed to identify messaging strategies to encourage vaccine uptake by measuring the drivers of COVID-19 vaccination among the general public. A survey to assess COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and hesitancy was advertised on Facebook in February-April 2022. The survey included items asking about COVID-19 vaccination status and participant demographics, and three scales assessing medical mistrust, perceived COVID-19 risk, and COVID-19 vaccine confidence (adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine confidence and complacency scale). The main outcome was vaccination, predicted by patient demographics and survey scale scores. Of 1,915 survey responses, 1,450 (75.7%) were included, with 1,048 (72.3%) respondents reporting they had been vaccinated. In a multivariable regression model, the COVID-19 vaccine confidence scale was the strongest predictor of vaccination, along with education level and perceived COVID-19 risk. Among the items on this scale, not all were equally important in predicting COVID-19 vaccination. The items that best predicted vaccination, at a given score on the COVID-19 vaccine confidence scale, included confidence that vaccine side effects are minimal, that the vaccine will work, that the vaccine will help the community, and that the vaccine provides freedom to move on with life. This study improved our understanding of perceptions most strongly associated with vaccine acceptance, allowing us to consider how to develop messages that may be particularly effective in encouraging vaccination among the general public for both the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health emergencies.",COVID-19 vaccine;communication;public health;survey;vaccine hesitancy,pandemic
Exploring the experiences of staff conducting psychology consultations via telehealth in an oncology hospital.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth delivery of psychological care services expanded to meet the needs of people with cancer. This study examined psychologists' attitudes toward using telehealth during the pandemic peak in a tertiary oncology hospital. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten psychologists who used telehealth to deliver psychological services. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes in the interview data. Themes identified: (1) increased uptake and attendance of psychology sessions was due to greater accessibility of services; (2) clinicians reported ease of communication and building of rapport when using telehealth; and (3) clinicians perceived differences in the psychotherapeutic process when sessions were delivered via telehealth compared to in-person. Clinicians expressed high satisfaction with delivering telehealth psychological support for oncology patients. Implications for Psychosocial Providers: Oncology services that are considering developing or expanding a telehealth psychology service can facilitate this by ensuring a reliable technological platform and providing training and/or support to staff and patients. Clinicians should also use their clinical judgment to decide if a patient is appropriate for telehealth-delivered psychological care or if a mix of modalities is more ideal.",Cancer;oncology;psychological therapy;telehealth,pandemic
Plausible Influence of HLA Class I and Class II Diversity on SARS-CoV-2 Vulnerability.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which adversely affected almost all aspects of human life and resulted in the loss of millions of lives, while affecting nearly 0.67 billion people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 still poses a challenge to the healthcare system as there are more than 200,000 active cases of COVID-19 around the globe. Epidemiological data suggests that the magnitude of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 was low in a few geographical regions and was unpredictably higher in a few regions. The genetic diversity of different geographical regions might explain the sporadic prevalence of the disease. In this context, human leukocyte antigens (HLA) represent the most polymorphic gene-dense region of the human genome and serve as an excellent mini-genome model for evaluating population genetic diversity in the context of susceptibility and progression of various diseases. In this review, we highlight the plausible influence of HLA in susceptibility, severity, immune response, and designing of epitope-based vaccines for COVID-19. Further, there is a need for extensive investigations for illustration and clarification of the functional impact of HLA class I and II alleles in the pathogenesis and progression of SARS-CoV-2.",,pandemic
"COVID-19 infodemic and health-related quality of life in patients with chronic respiratory diseases: A multicentre, observational study.","The explosion of information, misinformation and disinformation (the ""infodemic"") related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on digital and social media is reported to affect mental health and quality of life. However, reports assessing the COVID-19 infodemic on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with chronic diseases are scarce. In this study, we investigated the associations between the infodemic and HRQL in uninfected individuals with pre-existing chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other CRDs. We conducted a multi-national, cross-sectional, observational study in Canada, India, New Zealand and the United Kingdom where we distributed a set of digitised questionnaires among 1018 participants with chronic respiratory diseases who were not infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus at least three months prior to the study. We collected information about the infodemic such as news watching or social media use more than usual during the pandemic. HRQL was assessed using the short form of the chronic respiratory questionnaire (SF-CRQ). Demographic information, comorbidities, compliance, mental health, behavioural function, and social support were also recorded. We analysed the direct and indirect relationships between infodemic and HRQL using structural equation models (SEM). Of all participants, 54% were females and had a mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 53 (17) years. We found that higher infodemic was associated with worse emotional function (regression coefficient β = -0.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.14 to -0.01), which means a one SD change of the higher infodemic latent variable was associated with a 0.08 SD change of emotional function level. The association between higher infodemic and worse emotional function was mediated by worse mental health and behavioural functions but is marginally ameliorated by improved social support. In stratification analysis, we found significant disease and country-wise variations in the associations between infodemic and SF-CRQ domain scores. These results provide new evidence that the COVID-19 infodemic significantly influences the HRQL in patients with CRDs through a complex interplay between mental health, behavioural function, and social support. This new dimension of research also opens avenues for further research on infodemic-related health effects in other chronic diseases.",,pandemic
Vaccine Breakthrough Infections Among Healthcare Workers in a COVID-19-Designated Tertiary Care Government Hospital in Sikkim.,"Introduction Since the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus at the beginning of 2020, the world has gone through various waves of pandemics. The health care workers (HCWs) or the COVID warriors as they were termed were the first line of defense against the virus. They were armed with personal protective equipment and prophylactic doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Despite these precautions, some of the HCWs still contracted the disease and a few others succumbed to it. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 infections and vaccine breakthrough infections (BTIs) in HCWs after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine during the second wave of the pandemic. Methods This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based study conducted over a period of four months from September 2021 to December 2021 on HCWs aged 18 years and above working at the COVID-19-designated tertiary care government hospital in Sikkim. A structured coded questionnaire with no patient identifiers was used to gather details on demographics, vaccination history, breakthrough infection, and other social details. HCWs who had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the time of initiation of the study and were >18 years of age were included in this study. Results A total of 678 HCWs were screened, out of which 229 (33%) participants tested positive for COVID-19 and the rest of the participants (455; 67%) tested negative. COVID-19 infections and vaccine BTIs (COVID-19 infection >14 days after the second vaccination) were recorded and 137 (20%) respondents had a post-vaccination COVID-19 infection out of which 115 (18.5%) were BTI. The majority of the participants were females and of the age group of 26-35 years. The correlation of COVID-19 infections with the dose gap between vaccination, gender, age, profession, department, area posted during COVID duty, cycles of duty performed, hospitalization due to infection, influenza vaccination, and comorbidity was analyzed. Conclusion COVID-19 vaccines are disease-modifying and they decrease the severity of BTIs in HCWs. Pandemics and outbreaks cannot be predicted; therefore, it becomes very important to have healthy frontline workers who are constantly exposed to infectious agents. Monitoring of health and surveillance of infectious diseases among the HCWs should be encouraged.",breakthrough infection;covid-19;health care workers;sars-cov-2;sikkim,pandemic
Comparison of the Clinical and Metabolic Characteristics of Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes Between the Pre- and Post-lockdown Periods.,"In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak required restrictive measures to limit the spread of the virus. This study aimed to assess how changes in dietary habits and lifestyle associated with such measures have affected the characteristics of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in the post-lockdown period. In particular, we evaluated if the incidence of ACS was higher in younger patients, who were more negatively affected by lockdown measures. We analysed 609 ACS patients and compared the clinical, laboratory, and angiographic characteristics of those admitted six months before lockdown (n = 312) and those admitted in the same six-month period after lockdown. Moreover, we compared several anthropometric and laboratory data between pre- and post-lockdown in younger (≤55 years old) and older patients. The incidence of ACS in young adults (≤55 years) was significantly higher in the post- vs. pre-lockdown period (17.5% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.019). A trend to a higher percentage of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was observed in the post-lockdown period together with a significantly lower incidence of non-STEMI (p = 0.033). Moreover, in the post-lockdown period, we observed in younger patients a significant increase in weight, body mass index, admission glycaemia, and triglycerides while in older patients, these parameters were significantly reduced. The lockdown may have negatively affected cardiovascular risk, thus increasing the incidence of ACS, particularly in younger patients who probably underwent more relevant lifestyle changes, with several consequent anthropometric and metabolic alterations. Such evidence should be considered to take preventive measures in case a new state of emergency occurs.",acute coronary syndromes;covid-19;lockdown;metabolic alterations;young patients,pandemic

Applications of time series analysis in epidemiology: Literature review and our experience during COVID-19 pandemic.,"Time series analysis is a valuable tool in epidemiology that complements the classical epidemiological models in two different ways: Prediction and forecast. Prediction is related to explaining past and current data based on various internal and external influences that may or may not have a causative role. Forecasting is an exploration of the possible future values based on the predictive ability of the model and hypothesized future values of the external and/or internal influences. The time series analysis approach has the advantage of being easier to use (in the cases of more straightforward and linear models such as Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average). Still, it is limited in forecasting time, unlike the classical models such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed. Its applicability in forecasting comes from its better accuracy for short-term prediction. In its basic form, it does not assume much theoretical knowledge of the mechanisms of spreading and mutating pathogens or the reaction of people and regulatory structures (governments, companies, etc.). Instead, it estimates from the data directly. Its predictive ability allows testing hypotheses for different factors that positively or negatively contribute to the pandemic spread; be it school closures, emerging variants, etc. It can be used in mortality or hospital risk estimation from new cases, seroprevalence studies, assessing properties of emerging variants, and estimating excess mortality and its relationship with a pandemic.",Auto-regressive integrated moving average;COVID-19;Epidemiology;Excess mortality;Pandemic;Seroprevalence;Time series analysis,pandemic
Self-management of osteoarthritis while waiting for total knee arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic among older Malaysians.,"The study sought to understand the self-management strategies used by patients during the postponement of their total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedure, as well as the associations between the length of waiting time, pain, and physical frailty and function. The study focused on individuals aged 50 years and above, as they are known to be more vulnerable to the negative impacts of delayed elective surgery and rehabilitation. This study hypothesizes that delayed TKR due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will bear negative effect in self-management, pain, and physical frailty and function in older adults. To investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on self-management, pain, and physical function in older adults awaiting TKA in Malaysia. This cross-sectional study has the data of participants, who matched the criteria and scheduled for TKA for the first time, extracted from the TKA registry in the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Hospital Canselor Tuanku Mukhriz. Data on pain status, and self-management, physical frailty, and instrumental activities daily living were also collected. Multiple linear regression analysis with a significant level of 0.05 was used to identify the association between waiting time and pain on physical frailty and functional performance. Out of 180 had deferred TKA, 50% of them aged 50 years old and above, 80% were women with ethnic distribution Malay (66%), Chinese (22%), Indian (10%), and others (2%) respectively. Ninety-two percent of the participants took medication to manage their pain during the waiting time, while 10% used herbs and traditional supplements, and 68% did exercises as part of their osteoarthritis (OA) self-management. Thirty-six participants were found to have physical frailty (strength, assistance with walking, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and falls questionnaire score > 4) which accounted for 72%. Increased pain was associated with physical frailty with odds ratio, odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.46 (1.04-2.05). This association remained significant even after the adjustment according to age and self-management. While deferring TKA during a pandemic is unavoidable, patient monitoring for OA treatment during the waiting period is important in reducing physical frailty, ensuring the older patients' independence.",Aged;COVID-19;Functional performance;Osteoarthritis;Pain;Total knee arthroplasty,pandemic
"Circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and New Zealand, 2020-2021.","Circulation patterns of influenza and other respiratory viruses have been globally disrupted since the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the introduction of public health and social measures (PHSMs) aimed at reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. We reviewed respiratory virus laboratory data, Google mobility data and PHSMs in five geographically diverse regions in Australia and New Zealand. We also described respiratory virus activity from January 2017 to August 2021. We observed a change in the prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020. Influenza activity levels were very low in all regions, lower than those recorded in 2017-2019, with less than 1% of laboratory samples testing positive for influenza virus. In contrast, rates of human rhinovirus infection were increased. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity was delayed; however, once it returned, most regions experienced activity levels well above those seen in 2017-2019. The timing of the resurgence in the circulation of both rhinovirus and RSV differed within and between the two countries. The findings of this study suggest that as domestic and international borders are opened up and other COVID-19 PHSMs are lifted, clinicians and public health professionals should be prepared for resurgences in influenza and other respiratory viruses. Recent patterns in RSV activity suggest that these resurgences in non-COVID-19 viruses have the potential to occur out of season and with increased impact.",,pandemic
"Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Pre-pandemic among Adults Hospitalized with Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Older Adults.","Data are limited about influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the prevention of influenza-related hospitalizations in older adults and those with underlying high-risk comorbidities. We conducted a prospective test-negative case-control study at two US hospitals from October 2018-March 2020 among adults ≥50 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) and adults ≥18 years admitted with congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Adults were eligible if they resided in 1 of 8 counties in metropolitan Atlanta, GA. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested using BioFire® FilmArray® respiratory panel, and standard-of-care molecular results were included when available. Influenza vaccination history was determined from the Georgia vaccine registry and medical records. We used multivariable logistic regression to control for potential confounders and to determine 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among 3,090 eligible adults, 1562 (50.6%) were enrolled. Of the 1515 with influenza vaccination history available, 701 (46.2%) had received vaccination during that season. Influenza was identified in 37 (5.3%) vaccinated vs. 78 (9.6%) unvaccinated participants. After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, immunosuppression, month, and season, pooled VE for any influenza-related hospitalization in the eligible study population was 63.1% (95% CI: 43.8, 75.8). Adjusted VE against influenza-related hospitalization for ARI in adults ≥50 years was 55.9% (29.9, 72.3) and adjusted VE against Influenza-related CHF/COPD exacerbation in adults ≥18 years was 80.3% (36.3, 93.9).

Physical exercise-intervention can be valuable therapy for COVID-19 confinement and post-COVID-19 periods.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its transition into an endemic phase have profoundly impacted physical health, well-being, mental health, education, and various aspects of society, including the economy and social networks. Home confinement, social distancing, and physical inactivity have exacerbated numerous health issues, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, depression, and poor sleep quality. A systematic review has revealed significant findings: Regular aerobic programs (such as cycling or walking at an intensity of 60-80% of HR max for 20-60 minutes per session, repeated 2-3 times a week) have proven effective in improving both physical and mental health, as well as immune function. This type of physical activity has been shown to increase immunological markers, including lymphocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while reducing low-grade inflammation. Therefore, in this study we aimed to assess the impact of tailored exercise interventions on the physical and mental health of COVID-19 patients. Based on the results, we can establish exercise intervention strategies to mitigate the negative health consequences during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a search of the PubMed database from January 2020 to August 2023 using predefined search terms such as ""COVID-19 and post-COVID-19,"" ""exercise intervention and immunity,"" and ""mental health."" By examining references, we explored the links between exercise interventions and the mental and physical health of COVID-19 patients. A tailored, multifaceted exercise intervention should be developed and implemented to address the existing mental challenges and enhance mental health during both the pandemic and the post-COVID-19 periods. Breathing exercises and respiratory support techniques, including yoga, thoracic expansion exercises, airway clearance methods, and breathing control, are likely to be beneficial.",COVID-19;breathing exercise;mental health;physical activity;post-COVID-19 pandemic;valuable therapy,pandemic
"Prevalence of hospital-associated infections and its association with discharge destinations and hospital readmissions in Brussels, Belgium, from 2008 to 2020: A hospital-based, cross-sectional study.","To examine time trends of hospital-associated infections (HAIs) in people living in the Brussels-Capital Region, and to evaluate the consequences for hospitals and long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Cross-sectional analyses of yearly hospital administrative data. All Belgian hospitals and discharge destinations, focusing on LTCFs. All individuals from the Brussels-Capital Region hospitalized for >1 day throughout Belgium between 2008 and 2020 (N = 1,915,572). We calculated HAI prevalences and then, adjusting for confounders, the odds of being discharged to a LTCF or being readmitted within 30 days postdischarge after an HAI. HAIs included hospital-associated bloodstream infections, hospital-associated urinary tract infections, hospital-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical-site infections. Between 2008 and 2020, we identified 77,004 HAIs. Changes in time trends occurred. We observed a decrease of all HAIs from 2012 to 2014 from 5.17% to 2.19% (P < .001) and an increase from 2019 to 2020 from 3.38% to 4.06% (P < .001). Among patients with HAIs, 24.36% were discharged to LTCFs and 13.51% underwent early readmission. For stays ≥4 days, HAIs were associated with higher odds of LTCF discharge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.28), but with lesser odds of early readmission (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.90). Administrative data can be useful to detect HAIs trends, but they seem to underestimate the burden compared to surveillance systems. Risk factors of readmission should be identified during hospital stays to ensure continuity of care. Considering the results from 2020 coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, monitoring the impact of HAIs should continue.",,pandemic
"Toxic leadership, mental well-being and work engagement among nurses: a scale adaptation study and structural equation model approach.","Although the background on positive and supportive leadership styles and their positive effects is constantly increasing, it is known that negative and destructive leadership styles are less researched. Thus, examining the toxic leadership behaviors of nurse managers and the effects of these on nurses has a critical significance. When the measurement tools evaluating toxic leadership are examined, it is seen that there is a need for measurement tools that evaluate the toxic leadership behaviors of nurse managers. This study's purpose is to psychometrically examine the Turkish version of the Toxic Leadership Behaviors of Nurse Managers (ToxBH-NM-TR) Scale and test the hypothesized conceptual model that includes the relationships between toxic leadership, mental well-being and work engagement. This quantitative research was carried out in psychometric, correlational and cross-sectional design. A total of 559 nurses were included in the study by using the convenience sample method. The ToxBH-NM-TR Scale, Warwick-Edinburg Mental Well-Being Scale and Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) were used to measure the latent variables of the study. The data were collected between June and October 2020 with the online survey method. IBM SPSS Statistics 24 and Amos 21 statistical programs were used to analyze the data. The scale-content validity index of the ToxBH-NM-TR was 0.88. Confirmatory factor analysis results showed that the fit indices were acceptable. The ToxBH-NM-TR had high internal consistency and temporal stability. In addition, the relationships between the latent variables of the study were in the expected direction and statistically significant (p < 0.001). The hypothesized conceptual model showed an acceptable or good fit to the data. Mental well-being partially mediated the relationship between toxic leadership and work engagement. The study showed that the ToxBH-NM-TR is a valid and reliable instrument and provided evidence that confirmed the hypothesized conceptual model. The first of these is the fact that managers' toxic leadership behaviors were determined based on nurses' self-report. For this reason, participants' potential prejudices may have affected the results of the study. The second limitation concerns the data collection technique. Using face-to-face data collection techniques during the COVID-19 pandemic could create a danger/risk for the health of nurses, researchers and patients. Therefore, the nurses in this research were reached through an online survey on social media platforms. The participants of the study were limited to those who had access to social media. Finally, some socio-demographic and professional characteristics of the participants may be a confounding variable for the model. For this reason, this conceptual model needs to be validated on other samples in different countries to increase the generalizability of the research results. The characteristics of this leadership style should be understood, and its effects on employees and organizations should be evaluated by screening regularly to prevent the development of toxic leaders and to eliminate the harmful effects of their behavior. The nurses should respond decisively to the forces that cause them to submit in order not to encourage a toxic leadership style. Healthcare institutions should develop procedures and take a proactive approach to destructive and negative leadership behaviors and practices. In addition, nurse managers should get feedback by using informal networks and 360-degree assessment tools and evaluate whether their leadership has a toxic function by regularly screening the effects of their leadership. The results of this study offer important implications for nurses, managers and healthcare institutions and can be useful in gaining awareness about the negative effects of a toxic leadership style. In addition, the study provides a valid and reliable scale that will enable the identification of managers with this leadership style to prevent the development of toxic leaders and eliminate the harmful effects of their behavior.",Mental well-being;Nursing;Psychometric testing;Toxic leadership;Work engagement,pandemic
Inflammation and Mental Health Disorders: Immunomodulation as a Potential Therapy for Psychiatric Conditions.,"Mood disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide and their incidence has significantly increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continuous surge in the number of people diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, the treatment methods for these conditions remain limited. A significant number of people either do not respond to therapy or discontinue the drugs due to their severe side effects. Therefore, alternative therapeutic interventions are needed. Previous studies have shown a correlation between immunological alterations and the occurrence of mental health disorders, yet immunomodulatory therapies have been barely investigated for combating psychiatric conditions. In this article, we have reviewed the immunological alterations that occur during the onset of mental health disorders, including microglial activation, an increased number of circulating innate immune cells, reduced activity of natural killer cells, altered T cell morphology and functionality, and an increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This article also examines key studies that demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory medications in mental health disorders. These studies suggest that immunomodulation can potentially be used as a complementary therapy for controlling psychiatric conditions after careful screening of candidate drugs and consideration of their efficacy and side effects in clinical trials.",Anxiety;Bipolar Disorder;Depression;Immunomodulation;Mental Health Disorders;Schizophrenia,pandemic
Assessing the Frequency of COVID-19 in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI).,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global health crisis with significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial infarction and identify associated demographic and clinical characteristics. In this study, a retrospective and descriptive cross-sectional design was used to examine all patients (a total of 85) who experienced acute myocardial infarction and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The study measured various parameters, such as COVID-19 status, age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes, and hypertension. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25 software. Out of the 85 patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial infarction (MI), 14 patients (16.5%) were found to have COVID-19. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed through RT-PCR testing for 2 patients, while the remaining 12 patients were diagnosed using lung CT scans. Among the COVID-19 patients, 21.4% (n = 3) had background diabetes, and 7.1% (n = 1) had background hypertension. MI recurrence was observed in 14.3% of COVID-19 patients (2 cases). Unfortunately, 1 COVID-19 patient, a 70- year-old Persian woman with diabetes and hypertension, passed away. No significant differences were found in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, underlying diabetes, or underlying hypertension between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. The high occurrence of COVID-19 among myocardial infarction (MI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is worth noting. Further investigation is recommended to explore the impact of demographic and contextual factors on the severity and outcomes of primary PCI in MI patients with COVID-19, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved.",COVID-19;Diabetes;MI;PCI;acute respiratory syndrome.;cardiovascular disease,pandemic
The power of connected clinical teams: from loneliness to belonging.,"We need to preserve the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic in caring for the mental health of clinicians, of shared experiences, interdependence, team cohesion and vulnerability, among others. We need reform in the way that clinicians are cared for, and a resistance to the idea of a post-pandemic 'return to normal'. To build connected and optimally functioning clinical teams, we need to create an inclusive culture in which difficult conversations and caring are the expectation. If we are to be better at solving problems and better at serving our patients, we should be vigilant about creating a psychologically safe medical culture in which colleagues feel safe, seen, heard, and respected. Going forward, each of us, regardless of seniority, needs to take responsibility for this culture change. We need to create and participate in weekly collegial peer support sessions that feel nurturing and safe, that allow us to reveal parts of ourselves, to be vulnerable with each other in a way that reduces loneliness, and encourages and maintains social connections and a sense of belonging within clinical teams, improves clinician well-being and reduces the risk of burnout.

"Maintenance in relationships, satisfaction, jealousy, and violence in young couples: a network analysis.","The study explores the associations among Relationship Maintenance, Satisfaction, Jealousy, and Violence in young Peruvian couples, particularly in a post-pandemic context, using a network analysis. Eight hundred thirty-two participants aged 18-30 (M = 20.94, SD = 2.29), with 645 females (77.50%) and 187 males (22.50%), were involved. The study aimed to discern relationships among network nodes, emphasizing the link between Relationship Maintenance dimensions and Jealousy and Violence. The research also sought the central node in the network and examined gender-specific node connections, using the SMOTE algorithm for gender data balance. Findings revealed a direct connection between Complementarity and Jealousy, implying intense shared interests can lead to unhealthy dependence. An inverse relationship was seen between Companionship and Violence. Satisfaction was pivotal, showcasing its importance in romantic relationship success. Additionally, the study shows men prioritize Companionship and Sharing, possibly due to cultural norms, while women focus on the Companionship-Complementarity bond, indicating mutual support. The research emphasizes the critical role of maintenance variables in determining Satisfaction, Jealousy, and Violence in relationships. The pandemic's influence on romantic dynamics is evident, emphasizing the importance of Satisfaction. Future studies should focus on gender equity and further explore these relationships.",Jealousy;Network analysis;Pandemic;Relationship maintenance;Satisfaction;Violence;Young couples,pandemic
From policy to practice: a qualitive study exploring the role of community health workers during the COVID-19 response in Sierra Leone.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, community health workers (CHWs) were required to help their communities respond to the outbreak in Sierra Leone. The Government of Sierra Leone released a policy that provided an interim guidance on the specific role of CHWs during the pandemic including support required to maintain continuity of routine and essential services during the COVID-19 response. This study explores how CHWs adapted their roles during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sierra Leone and the support they received from families, communities, and the health system. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted in two districts in Sierra Leone. We conducted eight key informant interviews with district and community level managers and leaders and four focus group discussions with CHWs. Thematic data analysis and synthesis were guided by the interim guidance released by the Government of Sierra Leone at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and supported by NVivo 11. CHWs quickly took on COVID-19 frontline roles which included surveillance, contact tracing, social mobilization, and provision of psychosocial support. CHWs were trusted with these responsibilities as they were recognized as being knowledgeable about the community, were able to communicate effectively with community members and had experience of dealing with other outbreaks. Despite the release of the interim guidance aimed to optimize CHW contribution, motivate CHWs, ensure continuity of core and essential community-based services alongside COVID-19 services, CHWs faced many challenges in their work during the pandemic including heavy workload, low financial remuneration, lack of mental health support, and shortages of protective equipment, communication and transportation allowances. However, they were generally satisfied with the quality of the training and supervision they received. Support from families and communities was mixed, with some CHWs experiencing stigma and discrimination. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CHWs played a critical role in Sierra Leone. Although, a policy was released by the government to guide their role during the crisis, it was not fully implemented. This resulted in CHWs being overworked and under supported. It is important that CHWs are provided with the necessary training, tools and support to take on their vital roles in managing health crises at the community level. Strengthening the capacity of CHWs will not only enhance pandemic response, but also lay the foundation for improved primary health care delivery and community resilience in the face of future health emergencies.",CHWs;COVID-19;Community health workers;Sierra Leone,pandemic
"Access to healthcare services for people with non-communicable diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ibadan, Nigeria: a qualitative study.","Desirable outcomes for people with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are achieved when they access routine monitoring and care services. Expectedly, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted access to healthcare services, leading to poor health outcomes among people with NCDs. We aimed to [1] explore the delays in accessing healthcare services and [2] understand alternative actions adopted by people with NCDs to overcome these delays. We conducted an exploratory qualitative research guided by the ""Three Delays"" model to unpack the barriers to healthcare access for people living with NCDs in Ibadan, Nigeria. The ""Three Delays"" model conceptualizes the reasons for negative/adverse healthcare outcomes related to the patient's decision-making to seek healthcare, reaching an appropriate healthcare facility, and receiving adequate care at the healthcare facility. Twenty-five (25) people with NCDs were purposively selected from the University College Hospital's medical outpatient department to participate in in-depth interviews. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a deductive-inductive hybrid thematic analysis. At the level of individual decision-making, delays were related to fear of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital (considered a hotspot of the COVID-19 pandemic). Regarding reaching an appropriate healthcare facility, delays were mainly attributed to the intra- and inter-city lockdowns, limiting the movements of persons. For those who successfully arrived at the healthcare facilities, delays were related to the unavailability of healthcare professionals, prioritization of COVID-19 patients, and mandatory adherence to COVID-19 protocols, including COVID-19 testing. To overcome the delays mentioned above, people with NCDs resorted to (i) using private healthcare facilities, which were more costly, (ii) using virtual consultation through mobile phone Apps and (iii) self-management, usually by repeating previously prescribed prescriptions to obtain medication. Pandemic conditions provide unique challenges to people with chronic illnesses. Recognizing the need for continuous access to monitoring and care services under such conditions remains critical. Alternative health service provision approaches should be considered in pandemic situations, including remote healthcare services such as Mobile health apps (mHealth) that can help manage and prevent NCDs.",Access;COVID-19;Delay;Health care;Non-communicable diseases;mHealth,pandemic
Evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on hospital-acquired infections in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia.,"Infection prevention measures are the gold standard for preventing the spread of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions in infection prevention measures, and this has implications on the rate of HAIs. This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the rate and the types of HAIs at Sultan Ahmed Shah Hospital. This is a retrospective cohort study that compared the rate of HAIs from April to October 2019 (pre COVID period) and April to October 2020 (during COVID period). Data was collected through the review of patients' electronic medical records. There were a total of 578 patients included in the selected wards during the pre- and during the pandemic. Thirty-nine episodes (12.1%) of HAIs were report in the pre COVID period and 29 (11.3%) during COVID-19. In both periods, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was the most frequent HAI among the patients. There was a rise in catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) (0.8%) and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (1.1%) during the COVID-19 period. The most common bacteria were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (28.2%) and Enterococcus faecalis (17.9%) in the Pre COVID-19 period, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27.6%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.9%) during COVID-19. Our research concluded that the rates of HAIs during the COVID-19 pandemic were not significantly impacted by the improved in-hospital infection prevention efforts to control the pandemic. There is need for further efforts to promote adherence to preventive practices.",COVID-19;Hospital acquired infection;Infection prevention and control;Prevalence,pandemic
"Preparing future general practitioners: the effects of individual, familial, and institutional characteristics.","There is a substantially increasing need for general practitioners (GPs) for future unpredictable pandemic crises, especially at the community-based health services (CBHS) level to protect the vast and varied grassroot-level population in China. Thus, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect Chinese medical students' GP career choices and commitments to CBHS. Leveraging the self-administered data collected across the country, this study conducted logistic regressions with 3,438 medical students. First, descriptive statistics of outcome variables and independent variables were provided. Then, stepwise logistic regression models were built, starting from adding individual characteristics, and then familial and institutional characteristics. Last, post-estimation was conducted to further assess whether there were significant marginal effects. Results showed that women students were 24% less likely to choose GP careers but were 1.25 times more likely to commit to CBHS than their men peers, holding other individual, familial, and institutional characteristics constant. In addition, students who major in GP-orientated were more likely to choose GP careers and commit to CBHS, respectively, than those who major in clinical medicine. Furthermore, familial characteristics like annual income and mother's educational level only significantly predicted commitments to CBHS. Notably, sex-related differences in GP career choices and commitments to CBHS - by different regions - were observed. Understanding the factors that affect medical students' GP career choices sheds light on how medical education stakeholders can make informed decisions on attracting more medical students to GP-orientated majors, which in turn cultivates more GP professionals to meet the nation's demand for GPs. In addition, by understanding the factors that influence medical students' commitment to CBHS, policymakers could make beneficial policies to increase medical students' motivations to the grassroot-level health institutions, and devote to CBHS as gatekeepers for a large population of residents' health.",China;Community-based health service;General practitioner;Medical student;Sex-related difference,pandemic
"The perceived self-efficacy of senior, middle, and operations managers of the incident command system dealing with emergencies and disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Natural disasters, health, terrorism, infectious diseases, and social unrest affect more than 200 million people worldwide each year. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the self-efficacy of senior, middle, and operational managers of the Incident Command System (ICS) of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences in Iran. The study examined the perceived self-efficacy of 103 senior, middle, and operational managers of the Incidence Command System (ICS) of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences in 2021. Sampling was done by census using a designed questionnaire based on Bandura's self-efficacy concepts. Based on Factor Analysis, 4 factors were extracted. The factors were labeled and analyzed. The number of people who had passed the crisis management course was 57. Seventy-one participants reported their participation in crisis management. The score obtained by men in Factor 3 (F3) was significantly higher than women, but not in other factors. People with stable employment scored far higher in Factor 1 (F1) than those with unsustainable employment conditions. Those who had passed the Crisis Management courses had a higher average score, but only in the three factors 1, 2, and 4, this difference was significant. Even training the temporary staff is an organizational investment that can return benefits to the system. This enhances their perceived self-efficacy and promotes their commitment to the organization. Therefore, empowering these managers should be a priority.",COVID-19;Disasters;Emergencies;Incident Command System (ICS);Perceived self-efficacy,pandemic
The use of an educational video on forensic autopsy in curricular teaching for medical students-is it worth the effort? : A field report from lecturers and a survey among students.,"The purpose of this work is to share our experience with an educational video on forensic autopsy. Using questionnaires, we attempted to answer the following questions: Does watching the video trigger emotions in students? Does the autopsy meet the expectations that they had before? Does the video help to prepare them for their subsequent autopsy participation? A total of 365 medical students who attended their classes during the COVID-19 pandemic measures were provided with the video on an online platform. Links leading to questionnaires were positioned before and after the video. One hundred seventy-six students returned to face-to-face teaching during their course in forensic medicine. Those among them who chose to participate in an autopsy at our institute were given the link to a third questionnaire after their autopsy participation. The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS 27.0 and Microsoft Excel. One hundred seventy-two students completed a questionnaire before watching the educational video, 85 also completed one afterwards, and 28 completed the third questionnaire. The most intense feelings while watching the video were ""curiosity"" and ""surprise"". Out of twelve students (14.1%) who had imagined the autopsy differently in advance, five perceived the autopsy shown in the video as rougher or more brutal than expected. All autopsy participants who had previously viewed the video felt adequately prepared. Teaching should include an introduction to the handling of the corpse and the general procedures in the dissecting room. Although a video cannot substitute for personal interaction, it is useful to prepare students for their autopsy participation.",Autopsy video;Emotions triggered by autopsy;Handling of corpses;Teaching in forensic medicine,pandemic
"An efficient eco-friendly, simple, and green synthesis of some new spiro-N-(4-sulfamoyl-phenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-carboxamide derivatives as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteases: drug-likeness, pharmacophore, molecular docking, and DFT exploration.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a global health crisis. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory illness. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, and the development of new drugs is urgently needed. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) enzyme is a critical viral enzyme that plays a vital role in viral replication. The inhibition of Mpro enzyme can be an effective strategy for developing new COVID-19 drugs. An efficient operationally simple and convenient green synthesis method had been done towards a series of novel spiro-N-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-2-carboxamide derivatives, in ethanol at room temperature in green conditions, up to 90% yield. The molecular structures of the synthesized compounds were verified using spectroscopic methods.The title compounds were subjected to in silico analysis, including Lipinski's rule and ADMET prediction, in addition to pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking against the active site of SARS-CoV-2 target main protease (Mpro) enzyme (6LU7). Furthermore, both of the top-ranked compounds (5 and 6) and the standard Nirmatrelvir were subjected to DFT analysis. The synthesized compounds exhibited good binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme, with binding energy scores ranging from - 7.33 kcal/mol (compound 6) and - 7.22kcal/mol (compound 5) to - 6.54 kcal/mol (compounds 8 and 9). The top-ranked compounds (5 and 6) had lower HOMO-LUMO energy difference (ΔE) than the standard drug Nirmatrelvir. This highlights the potential and relevance of charge transfer at the molecular level. These findings suggest that the synthesized spiro-N-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-2-carboxamide derivatives could be potential candidates for COVID-19 drug development. To confirm these drugs' antiviral efficacy in vivo, more research is required. With very little possibility of failure, this proven method could aid in the search for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic's desperately needed medications.","4-Sulfamoylphenylcarboxamide;Green synthesis;Spirooazoles,1,3,4-thiadiazole;Thiocarbohydrazide",pandemic
"[Inpatient surgical treatment in mass casualty situations and disasters-Principles, targets, concepts, preparation].","The war in Ukraine and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have moved the resilience of the healthcare system in Germany into the focus of a broad discussion. The preparation for such a damage situation is characterized by the relationship between the available treatment capacity and needs which go far beyond the norm. The aim of a resilient healthcare system must be to adequately react to such exceptional situations. Particularly in acute disaster and mass casualty situations, medical standards and an individualized surgical treatment must be maintained for as long as possible. The aim of this article is to elucidate the current terminology on medical treatment of patients in disasters from a surgical perspective, to further develop available concepts and possible concepts of crisis management based on three schematically presented scenarios. Furthermore, the general reaction possibilities for mobilization of treatment capacities are described. In order to uniformly collate the quality of medical treatment in a damage situation, it is meaningful to include the stages of individualized treatment, compensated crisis care and decompensated crisis care. Within the framework of a mass casualty situation or a disaster, traumatological and surgical patients are predominant and the aim must be to maintain or restore the stage of a compensated crisis management. Depending on the extent of the damage situation, this can only be realized in a timely manner independent of state boundaries and by a superordinate central management structure. For a comprehensive provision of surgical treatment capacities, the depiction of a continuous overview of the situation with current resources and structural data of the hospitals in the affected region is necessary. The aim of all efforts and preparations must therefore be to durably strengthen hospitals and to train and develop this with respect to coping with a damage situation in disaster medicine. In this respect it is important to establish a consensus on terminology, the type of treatment and the tactical strategic principles of surgical treatment to cope with a disaster or damage situation.",Central management structure;Compensated crisis care;Contingency care;Healthcare system;Patient medical treatment in catastrophes;Treatment capacity,pandemic
Changes in Site of Death Among Older Adults Without a COVID-19 Diagnosis During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Understanding how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected site of death-an important patient-centered outcome related to end-of-life care-would inform healthcare system resiliency in future public health emergencies. To evaluate the changes in site of death during the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults without a COVID-19 diagnosis. Using a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences method, we estimated net changes in site of death during the pandemic period (March-December 2020) from the pre-pandemic period (January-February 2020), using data on the same months in prior years (2016-2019) as the control. A 20% sample of Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries aged 66 years and older who died in 2016-2020. We excluded beneficiaries with a hospital diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed each of the following sites of death separately: (1) home or community; (2) acute care hospital; and (3) nursing home. We included 1,133,273 beneficiaries without a hospital diagnosis of COVID-19. We found that the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries who died at home or in the community setting increased (difference-in-differences [DID] estimate, + 3.1 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, + 2.6 to + 3.6 pp; P < 0.001) and the proportion of beneficiaries who died (without COVID-19 diagnosis) in an acute care hospital decreased (- 0.8 pp; 95% CI, - 1.2 to - 0.4 pp; P < 0.001) during the pandemic. We found no evidence that the proportion of deaths in nursing homes changed during the pandemic. Using national data on older adults without a COVID-19 diagnosis, we found that site of death shifted toward home or community settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings may inform clinicians and policymakers in supporting end-of-life care during future public health emergencies.",COVID-19 pandemic;end-of-life care;site of death,pandemic
A Model of Burnout Among Healthcare Professionals.,"Burnout is common and can lead to worse outcomes for both healthcare workers and patients. Our study purpose was to assess the structural relationship among factors that protect against or worsen burnout. We surveyed healthcare professionals in 15 different Japanese intensive care units during the 3rd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2021). Surveys assessed burnout (Mini Z 2.0), resilience (Brief Resilience Scale), depressive (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms, job and work environment characteristics, and personal experience with COVID. We explored survey domains with principal component factor analysis and modeled our results using structural equation modeling. Among 936 ICU professionals, 24.3% met criteria for burnout. Our model suggested that resilience (β =  - 0.26, 95% CI - 0.32 to - 0.20), teamwork (β =  - 0.23, 95% CI - 0.30 to - 0.16), and feeling safe (β =  - 0.11, 95% CI - 0.18 to - 0.04) reduced burnout. Depression (β =  - 0.32, 95% CI - 0.41 to - 0.23) and anxiety (β =  - 0.20, 95% CI - 0.29 to - 0.10) both decreased resilience as did COVID fear (β = 0.08, 95% CI - 0.14 to - 0.02). In addition to directly reducing resilience, anxiety also indirectly reduced resilience by increasing COVID fear (0.23, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.23), which decreased resilience (β - 0.08, 95% CI - 0.14 to - 0.02). Burnout is common among Japanese ICU professionals. Resilience, teamwork, and safety are all correlated with reduced burnout. Those who had depression or anxiety or COVID fear had higher degrees of burnout, an effect that appears to be mediated by reduced resilience. These are potential targets for interventions to reduce burnout.",,pandemic
Recent co-evolution of two pandemic plant diseases in a multi-hybrid swarm.,"Most plant pathogens exhibit host specificity but when former barriers to infection break down, new diseases can rapidly emerge. For a number of fungal diseases, there is increasing evidence that hybridization plays a major role in driving host jumps. However, the relative contributions of existing variation versus new mutations in adapting to new host(s) is unclear. Here we reconstruct the evolutionary history of two recently emerged populations of the fungus Pyricularia oryzae that are responsible for two new plant diseases: wheat blast and grey leaf spot of ryegrasses. We provide evidence that wheat blast/grey leaf spot evolved through two distinct mating episodes: the first occurred ~60 years ago, when a fungal individual adapted to Eleusine mated with another individual from Urochloa. Then, about 10 years later, a single progeny from this cross underwent a series of matings with a small number of individuals from three additional host-specialized populations. These matings introduced non-functional alleles of two key host-specificity factors, whose recombination in a multi-hybrid swarm probably facilitated the host jump. We show that very few mutations have arisen since the founding event and a majority are private to individual isolates. Thus, adaptation to the wheat or Lolium hosts appears to have been instantaneous, and driven entirely by selection on repartitioned standing variation, with no obvious role for newly formed mutations.",,pandemic

Relative Risk of COVID-19 Reinfection by Demographic and Vaccination Factors During the Period March 2020-October 2022.,"The risk of reinfection has been difficult to quantify throughout the pandemic, making the case for COVID-19 vaccination and receipt of booster doses to the public difficult for the public health community. To address this question, Michigan statewide COVID-19 infection and vaccination data was utilized in this cross-sectional study to determine the risk of reinfection by vaccination status. Cases were divided into subgroups by vaccination status, and the risk of reinfection in the various vaccination categories was then calculated by dividing the cumulative incidence of reinfection in a vaccine category by the cumulative incidence of reinfection of those not in that category Within this population, the risk of becoming reinfected was 1.6 times higher for those who were unvaccinated than those who were vaccinated; those with a primary series saw a 27% reduced risk of reinfections compared to those without a primary series. Those with an additional booster dose had a modest improvement, with 35% reduced risk of reinfection when compared to the other groups combined. These results provide population level data to support current public health vaccination recommendations.",Age;Boosters;COVID-19;Primary Series;Reinfection;Vaccination,pandemic
"B-cell and antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2: infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity.","The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 prompted scientific, medical, and biotech communities to investigate infection- and vaccine-induced immune responses in the context of this pathogen. B-cell and antibody responses are at the center of these investigations, as neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are an important correlate of protection (COP) from infection and the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine modalities. In addition to absolute levels, nAb longevity, neutralization breadth, immunoglobulin isotype and subtype composition, and presence at mucosal sites have become important topics for scientists and health policy makers. The recent pandemic was and still is a unique setting in which to study de novo and memory B-cell (MBC) and antibody responses in the dynamic interplay of infection- and vaccine-induced immunity. It also provided an opportunity to explore new vaccine platforms, such as mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccines, in unprecedented cohort sizes. Combined with the technological advances of recent years, this situation has provided detailed mechanistic insights into the development of B-cell and antibody responses but also revealed some unexpected findings. In this review, we summarize the key findings of the last 2.5 years regarding infection- and vaccine-induced B-cell immunity, which we believe are of significant value not only in the context of SARS-CoV-2 but also for future vaccination approaches in endemic and pandemic settings.",IgG4;SARS-CoV-2;memory responses;neutralizing antibodies;vaccines,pandemic
Leveraging three-tier deep learning model for environmental cleaner plants production.,"The world's population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, necessitating a 70% increase in agricultural output and food production to meet the demand. Due to resource shortages, climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and highly harsh socioeconomic predictions, such a demand is challenging to complete without using computation and forecasting methods. Machine learning has grown with big data and high-performance computers technologies to open up new data-intensive scientific opportunities in the multidisciplinary agri-technology area. Throughout the plant's developmental period, diseases and pests are natural disasters, from seed production to seedling growth. This paper introduces an early diagnosis framework for plant diseases based on fog computing and edge environment by IoT sensors measurements and communication technologies. The effectiveness of employing pre-trained CNN architectures as feature extractors in identifying plant illnesses has been studied. As feature extractors, standard pre-trained CNN models, AlexNet are employed. The obtained in-depth features are eliminated by proposing a revised version of the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm that approved its efficiency through experiments. The features subset selected were used to train the SVM classifier. Ten datasets for different plants are utilized to assess the proposed model.

"National trends in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis prevalence in South Korea, 1998-2021.","Studies on the trends in the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are limited, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to analyze the temporal trend of RA and OA in South Korean adults from 1998 to 2021, including the COVID-19 pandemic period. The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data on adults aged ≥ 19 years were analyzed to investigate the prevalence of RA and OA from 1998 to 2021. The prevalence trends were compared by the years, and βdiff (β difference) was calculated. Odds ratios (ORs) were computed for each disease to examine changes in disease prevalence before and during the pandemic in order to determine the impact of the pandemic on disease prevalence. Among 163,221 Korean adults, the prevalence of RA and OA showed a steady decrease from 2005 (RA: from 1.91% in 2005-2007 to 1.55% in 2016-2019 and OA: from 9.75% in 2005-2007 to 8.27% in 2016-2019), but there was a slight increased after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (RA: from 1.23% in 2020 to 1.36% in 2021 and OA: from 8.04% in 2020 to 8.27% in 2021). Vulnerable groups, including participants aged ≥ 60 years (versus 19-60 years, ratio of ORs: 1.222; 95% CI 1.011-1.477), urban residents (ratio of ORs: 1.289; 95% CI 1.007-1.650), and participants with higher education level (ratio of ORs: 1.360; 95% CI 1.119-1.653) showed higher ORs of OA, whereas no particularly vulnerable population was observed for RA. Our findings provide an insight into the long-term trends of RA and OA among adult population and highlight a novel perspective on the impact of COVID-19 on disease prevalence.",,pandemic
Wellness Among Interventional Radiologists: Results From a Multidimensional Survey.,"To evaluate wellness among interventional radiologists using a multidimensional survey. An anonymous 53-item survey, including 36 Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS) prompts, was created in Qualtrics (an online survey tool) to assess wellness among interventional radiology attendings and residents. The survey was open from June to September, 2022, 2 years into the COVID-19 Pandemic. The survey was distributed via Society of Interventional Radiology Forums, social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook), and personal correspondence. PWS scores were categorized into Wellness Composite and subscores (physical, emotional, intellectual, psychological, social, and spiritual). 367 surveys were completed. 300 (81.7%) respondents were male and 67 (18.3%) were female. Respondents included attending physicians (297; 81.0%) and residents (70; 19.0%). Practice settings included academic (174; 47.4%), private (114; 31.0%), private-academic hybrid (62; 16.9%), and others (17; 4.7%). Mean Wellness Composite at academic centers (14.74 ± 3.16; range: 5.42-23.50) was significantly lower than at private (15.22 ± 3.37; range: 6.13-23.51) and hybrid (16.14 ± 2.47; range: 10.20-23.50) practices (p = 0.01). Respondents < 40 years old had significantly lower emotional wellness subscores compared to those ≥ 40 years old (4.34 ± 0.86 vs. 4.60 ± 0.87; p = 0.006). There were no significant differences between geographic regions in the United States, however, International respondents had significantly lower social and intellectual wellness (INT) subscores. Physical wellness subscore (4.00 ± 0.9) was significantly lower than the other subscores (4.59 ± 0.81) (p < .001). Overall mean Wellness Composite was 15.11 ± 3.13 (range: 5.42-23.51). Overall self-reported wellness was lower among interventional radiologists practicing at academic centers. Interventional Radiologists < 40 years old and residents had lower emotional wellness, while international respondents had lower social and INT.

'The burden of wanting to make it right': thematic analysis of semistructured interviews to explore experiences of planning for crisis standards of care and ventilator allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA.,"The COVID-19 pandemic prompted planning for clinical surges and associated resource shortages, particularly of equipment such as ventilators. We sought to examine the experience of the healthcare professionals who created policies for crisis standards of care, and allocation of ventilators in the event of shortage. To that end, we conducted semistructured interviews with healthcare professionals in the USA involved in institutional planning for resource shortages in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. USA. We conducted 25 interviews between May and July 2021. Half of the respondents were female (48%), many from Northeastern institutions (52%), and most practised in academic institutions (92%). Many (64%) respondents reported that their institution had an approved policy to guide ventilator allocation in the event of a shortage. We identified one overarching theme: the work of planning for resource shortages imposed a psychological burden on many planners. We identified four subthemes that influenced that burden: impact of leadership, institutional variation in process and policies, faith in the policies and future directions. Improved leadership strategies and cross-institutional collaboration can reduce the psychological burden of planning and facilitate updating plans in anticipation of future shortages.",COVID-19;health policy;public health,pandemic
How can NHS trusts in England optimise strategies to improve the mental health and well-being of hospital doctors? The Care Under Pressure 3 (CUP3) realist evaluation study protocol.,"The growing incidence of mental ill health in doctors was a major issue in the UK and internationally, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has significant and far-reaching implications, including poor quality or inconsistent patient care, absenteeism, workforce attrition and retention issues, presenteeism, and increased risk of suicide. Existing approaches to workplace support do not take into account the individual, organisational and social factors contributing to mental ill health in doctors, nor how interventions/programmes might interact with each other within the workplace. The aim of this study is to work collaboratively with eight purposively selected National Health Service (NHS) trusts within England to develop an evidence-based implementation toolkit for all NHS trusts to reduce doctors' mental ill health and its impacts on the workforce. The project will incorporate three phases. Phase 1 develops a typology of interventions to reduce doctors' mental ill health. Phase 2 is a realist evaluation of the existing combinations of strategies being used by acute English healthcare trusts to reduce doctors' mental ill health (including preventative promotion of well-being), based on 160 interviews with key stakeholders. Phase 3 synthesises the insights gained through phases 1 and 2, to create an implementation toolkit that all UK healthcare trusts can use to optimise their strategies to reduce doctors' mental ill health and its impact on the workforce and patient care. Ethical approval has been granted for phase 2 of the project from the NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC reference number 22/WA/0352). As part of the conditions for our ethics approval, the sites included in our study will remain anonymous. To ensure the relevance of the study's outputs, we have planned a wide range of dissemination strategies: an implementation toolkit for healthcare leaders, service managers and doctors; conventional academic outputs such as journal manuscripts and conference presentations; plain English summaries; cartoons and animations; and a media engagement campaign.",MENTAL HEALTH;Organisation of health services;Protocols & guidelines,pandemic
Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in childhood encephalitis (IgNiTE): a randomised controlled trial.,"To investigate whether intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) improves neurological outcomes in children with encephalitis when administered early in the illness. Phase 3b multicentre, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-one hospitals in the UK. Children aged 6 months to 16 years with a diagnosis of acute or subacute encephalitis, with a planned sample size of 308. Two doses (1 g/kg/dose) of either IVIG or matching placebo given 24-36 hours apart, in addition to standard treatment. The primary outcome was a 'good recovery' at 12 months after randomisation, defined as a score of≤2 on the Paediatric Glasgow Outcome Score Extended. The secondary outcomes were clinical, neurological, neuroimaging and neuropsychological results, identification of the proportion of children with immune-mediated encephalitis, and IVIG safety data. 18 participants were recruited from 12 hospitals and randomised to receive either IVIG (n=10) or placebo (n=8) between 23 December 2015 and 26 September 2017. The study was terminated early following withdrawal of funding due to slower than anticipated recruitment, and therefore did not reach the predetermined sample size required to achieve the primary study objective; thus, the results are descriptive. At 12 months after randomisation, 9 of the 18 participants (IVIG n=5/10 (50%), placebo n=4/8 (50%)) made a good recovery and 5 participants (IVIG n=3/10 (30%), placebo n=2/8 (25%)) made a poor recovery. Three participants (IVIG n=1/10 (10%), placebo n=2/8 (25%)) had a new diagnosis of epilepsy during the study period. Two participants were found to have specific autoantibodies associated with autoimmune encephalitis. No serious adverse events were reported in participants receiving IVIG. The IgNiTE (ImmunoglobuliN in the Treatment of Encephalitis) study findings support existing evidence of poor neurological outcomes in children with encephalitis. However, the study was halted prematurely and was therefore underpowered to evaluate the effect of early IVIG treatment compared with placebo in childhood encephalitis.

Examining Nursing Students' Experiences During COVID-19 Through a Psychosocial Development Lens.,"Background and Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative study was to evaluate experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic on freshman and sophomore residential nursing students in relation to personal development. Findings are examined through the lens of Chickering's seven vectors of psychosocial development to better understand the implications of nursing students' challenges during COVID-19. Methods: A convenience sample of residential nursing students completed surveys eliciting narrative descriptions of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives while in college. Results: Five main themes were identified as personal consequences of the pandemic: loss of connection with peers and instructors, loss of focus, loss of motivation, physical isolation, and emotional isolation. Findings were discussed through the lens of Chickering's seven vectors of psychosocial development to better understand the implications of students' COVID experiences. Implications for Practice: The results of the study suggest that students may have experienced obstacles from the effects of COVID-19, which may affect their psychosocial and identity development. An understanding of the personal consequences of COVID-19 on residential nursing students may assist faculty and administrators as they develop opportunities for social interactions that serve as a foundation for psychosocial development.",COVID-19;identity development;isolation;nursing students;qualitative,pandemic

Co-learning and co-teaching in a newly introduced research learning community.,"Research clerkships are usually designed as individual learning projects focusing on research skills training, such as research design, data analysis and reporting. When the COVID-19 pandemic triggered an urgent need for digital education, we redesigned a research clerkship with the challenging aim to maintain original quality for more students than usual with limited teaching staff. We introduced the concept of a research learning community (RLC) with co-teaching and co-learning to a group of 14 students and seven teaching faculty using digital platforms. Small groups of students participated in the RLC, which was supervised weekly by the teachers. Research experts were continuously involved and led workshops. Using a qualitative design, we analysed experiences from the perspectives of students and faculty. We performed an inductive thematic content analysis of three focus group interviews and used 14 student reports for triangulation. The results indicate that apart from developing research skills, students valued peer assistance, attention to uncertainty and learning beyond individual research projects. The teachers/research experts reported that co-teaching and co-learning had contributed to their professional development. In terms of organisation, students and faculty recognised that the RLC model allowed for interdisciplinary learning, facilitated by a digital platform. To develop students' research skills, embedding a clerkship in an RLC is an attractive alternative to individual research clerkships. The obligatory learning goals are met. Co-learning and co-teaching foster faculty's and students' professional development. When translating to other curricula, we recommend stating common goals in addition to individual objectives.",,pandemic
Underuse of SARS-CoV-2-Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies in Skilled Nursing Facilities.,"Little is known about deployment of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mab) in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), a high-risk population for COVID-19-related complications. We assessed the utilization of mabs in SNFs and identified facility characteristics associated with effective use. Retrospective cohort study assessing the correlation of SNF characteristics with increasing mab use. United States SNFs participating in Project ECHO (Extensions for Community Health Outcomes). The primary outcome was percentage of total mabs per COVID-19 cases in SNFs. Facilities were divided into 3 groups based on the percentage of the administration of mabs per number of cases: 0%, >0% to 20%, >20%. Ordinal logistic regression was applied to assess whether facility characteristics-study group, state, location, type, size, rating at baseline, weekly average of residents vaccinated, weekly average of staff vaccinated, and total weeks short staffed-correlated with the primary outcome. A multivariable model was used to evaluate the independent effect of predictors. A total of 130 facilities were included. Between the weeks ending on May 30, 2021, and on May 29, 2022, mean mab use when accounting for the number of COVID-19 cases was 12.96% (±26.71%) and >50% of facilities administered 0 doses of mabs. Facility location was associated with mab use (P value .030), with micropolitan facilities having the highest percentage of facilities administering mabs (30.4% in >0% to 20%, and 39.1% in >20%, respectively). There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased mab use in facilities reporting fewer staffing shortages. When the multivariable ordinal logistic regression model was applied, location in a micropolitan vs metropolitan area was associated with higher odds [3.29 (1.30, 8.32), P value .012] of increasing percentage total mabs per cases. COVID-19 mabs were underutilized in a high-risk population for COVID-19 hospitalization and death.

"Management and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted in a newly created ICU and an expert ICU, a retrospective observational study.","The COVID-19 pandemic abruptly increased the inflow of patients requiring intensive care units (ICU). French health institutions responded by a twofold capacity increase with temporary upgraded beds, supplemental beds in pre-existing ICUs, or newly created units (New-ICU). We aimed to compare outcomes according to admission in expert pre-existing ICUs or in New-ICU. This multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted in two 20-bed expert ICUs of a University Hospital (Expert-ICU) and in one 16-bed New-ICU in a private clinic managed respectively by 3 and 2 physicians during daytime and by one physician during the night shift. All consecutive adult patients with COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure admitted after centralized regional management by a dedicated crisis cell were included. The primary outcome was 180-day mortality. Propensity score matching and restricted cubic spline for predicted mortality over time were performed. During the study period, 165 and 176 patients were enrolled in Expert-ICU and New-ICU respectively, 162 (98%) and 157 (89%) patients were analyzed. The unadjusted 180-day mortality was 30.8% in Expert-ICU and 28.7% in New-ICU, (log-rank test, p = 0.7).

A bivalent form of a RBD-specific synthetic antibody effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is severely impacting the world, and tremendous efforts have been made to deal with it. Despite many advances in vaccines and therapeutics, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants remains an intractable challenge. We present a bivalent Receptor Binding Domain (RBD)-specific synthetic antibody, specific for the RBD of wild-type (lineage A), developed from a non-antibody protein scaffold composed of LRR (Leucine-rich repeat) modules through phage display. We further reinforced the unique feature of the synthetic antibody by constructing a tandem dimeric form. The resulting bivalent form showed a broader neutralizing activity against the variants. The in vivo neutralizing efficacy of the bivalent synthetic antibody was confirmed using a human ACE2-expressing mouse model that significantly alleviated viral titer and lung infection.

Interprofessional Teamwork: A Qualitative Study on Adapting Central Policies to Local Conditions in a Labour and Delivery Unit.,"We record the experiences of staff in a labour, delivery and obstetric services (LD-OBS) unit in Alberta's largest quaternary medical centre-the Foothills Medical Centre (FMC)-as they navigated hospital policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine how unit leadership applied these policies to better align with care delivery realities while staying true to the interprofessional nature of the unit. 12 semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with LD-OBS unit staff. Snowball and purposive sampling strategies were used to capture experiences from key informants. Interview transcripts underwent inductive coding. Themes identified through this process were discussed with members of the authorial team until consensus was reached. FMC LD-OBS team members used 'interprofessional' as a value through which to interpret, adapt, and implement centrally developed COVID-19 policies. These were applied at three key moments: reconfiguring the unit, triaging and rerouting patients, and contesting central personal protective equipment (PPE) policies. LD-OBS leaders championed the importance of interprofessional collaboration and teamwork on the unit and worked to uphold it as a practice and value. The COVID-19 pandemic experience of the FMC LD-OBS unit illustrates the importance of considering interprofessionalism as a core value as policy was developed and implemented. Health authorities, hospitals, and other LD-OBS units may wish to consider how inteprofessional work affects policy interpretation among health care teams, and how this may be leveraged to successfully adapt policies to local units, under both pandemic and 'normal' conditions.",COVID-19;interprofessionalism;labour and delivery;obstetrics;quaternary care,pandemic
"Sleep, brain systems, and persistent stress in early adolescents during COVID-19: Insights from the ABCD study.","The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a major life stress event for many adolescents, associated with disrupted school, behaviors, social networks, and health concerns. However, pandemic-related stress was not equivalent for everyone and could have been influenced by pre-pandemic factors including brain structure and sleep, which both undergo substantial development during adolescence. Here, we analyzed clusters of perceived stress levels across the pandemic and determined developmentally relevant pre-pandemic risk factors in brain structure and sleep of persistently high stress during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated longitudinal changes in perceived stress at six timepoints across the first year of the pandemic (May 2020-March 2021) in 5559 adolescents (50 % female; age range: 11-14 years) in the United States (U.S.) participating in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. In 3141 of these adolescents, we fitted machine learning models to identify the most important pre-pandemic predictors from structural MRI brain measures and self-reported sleep data that were associated with persistently high stress across the first year of the pandemic. Patterns of perceived stress levels varied across the pandemic, with 5 % reporting persistently high stress. Our classifiers accurately detected persistently high stress (AUC > 0.7). Pre-pandemic brain structure, specifically cortical volume in temporal regions, and cortical thickness in multiple parietal and occipital regions, predicted persistent stress. Pre-pandemic sleep difficulties and short sleep duration were also strong predictors of persistent stress, along with more advanced pubertal stage. Adolescents showed variable stress responses during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and some reported persistently high stress across the whole first year. Vulnerability to persistent stress was evident in several brain structural and self-reported sleep measures, collected before the pandemic, suggesting the relevance of other pre-existing individual factors beyond pandemic-related factors, for persistently high stress responses.",Adolescents;Imaging data;Puberty;Sleep;Stress,pandemic
The value of point-of-care tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from donor to recipient is a clinically relevant risk for developing severe COVID-19 after lung transplantation (LTx). This risk of iatrogenic transmission can be reduced by timely detection of viral RNA or antigen in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained at the time of lung procurement. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in BAL fluid samples using three point-of-care tests (POCTs). BAL fluid samples came from patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These pandemic samples were scored as positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 by a comparator RT-qPCR assay for orf1ab. Three commercially available POCTs were then evaluated: cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay with the cobas Liat RT-qPCR system (Roche Diagnostics), ID NOW COVID-19 and COVID-19 2.0 (Abbott), and SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) (Roche Diagnostics). Samples from the pre-pandemic era served as negative controls. We analyzed a total of 98 BAL fluid samples, each from a different patient: 58 positive pandemic samples (orf1ab Ct<38), 20 putatively negative pandemic samples (orf1ab Ct≥38), and 20 pre-pandemic samples. Univariate logistic regression shows that the probability of detection was highest for cobas Liat, followed by ID NOW, and then RAT. Of clinical relevance, cobas Liat detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 30 of the 31 positive pandemic samples that were collected within ten days after RT-qPCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the 20 pre-pandemic samples had a false-positive result for any POCT. POCTs enable the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in BAL fluid samples and may provide additional information to decide if donor lungs are suitable for transplantation. Detection of respiratory pathogens with POCTs at the time of donor lung procurement is a potential strategy to increase safety in LTx by preventing iatrogenic transmission and severe postoperative infections.",COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2;bronchoalveolar lavage;lung transplantation;point-of-care test,pandemic
The anti-SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation and expression of embryo-fetal globin genes in human erythroleukemia K562 cells.,"The COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, that were fundamental for the reduction of the viral spread within the population and the clinical severity of COVID-19. However, the S-protein has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Considering the impact of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection on the hematopoietic system, the aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. In this context, we focused on hemoglobin production and induced expression of embryo-fetal globin genes, that are among the most important features of K562 erythroid differentiation. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of α-globin and γ-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of ζ-globin and ε-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.",COVID-19 vaccine;Embryo-fetal hemoglobins;Erythroid differentiation;K562 cells;Mithramycin;SARS-CoV-2,pandemic
RAGE engagement by SARS-CoV-2 enables monocyte infection and underlies COVID-19 severity.,"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has fueled the COVID-19 pandemic with its enduring medical and socioeconomic challenges because of subsequent waves and long-term consequences of great concern. Here, we chart the molecular basis of COVID-19 pathogenesis by analyzing patients' immune responses at single-cell resolution across disease course and severity. This approach confirms cell subpopulation-specific dysregulation in COVID-19 across disease course and severity and identifies a severity-associated activation of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) pathway in monocytes. In vitro THP1-based experiments indicate that monocytes bind the SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) via RAGE, pointing to RAGE-Spike interaction enabling monocyte infection. Thus, our results demonstrate that RAGE is a functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 contributing to COVID-19 severity.",,pandemic
A Novel Percutaneous Snare-Assisted Manipulation and Repositioning of a ProtekDuo Cannula in a COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.,"Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [VV-ECMO] has gained increasing notoriety during the COVID-19 pandemic as a salvation therapy for fulminant respiratory failure. Various configurations can present unique challenges in management. For instance, the ProtekDuo cannula is a 29Fr to 31Fr dual-lumen cannula inserted by way of the right internal jugular vein that allows for right atrium to pulmonary artery bypass with an attached oxygenator, essentially resulting in VV-ECMO. Understanding that these different configurations inevitably dictate the types of complications that can arise during the circuit implantation and management is imperative. However, in a hemodynamically unstable patient, time or resources may not permit standard maneuvers for management. In conclusion, we present an innovative, percutaneous approach which allowed the restoration of flow and oxygenation in a decompensating ProtekDuo patient without having to explant/disconnect the circuit or implant a new VV-ECMO circuit.",COVID-19;Gooseneck snare;ProtekDuo;VV-ECMO,pandemic
Changing pattern of circulating dengue serotypes in the endemic region: An alarming risk to the healthcare system during the pandemic.,"The pandemic of COVID-19 has created an unprecedented burden on the healthcare system and medical communities resulting in new public health challenges. On the other hand, in tropical countries, another concern arises due to the similar spectrum of clinical manifestations between COVID-19 and dengue fever. Thus, the neglected tropical disease 'Dengue' writhed with more inattention. This study aims to find the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on dengue infections in endemic areas of West Bengal, India, and their combined impact on public health. The alterations in circulating dengue serotype and their genomic diversity in different COVID-19 waves were also monitored. A total of 1782 patients were included in this study. Dengue NS1 ELISA, molecular serotyping, genotyping and their phylogenetic analysis were performed. GISaided analysis of various dengue serotypes and hotspot identification for risk maps of severe dengue in endemic zones were done. The burden of dengue fever and the sustainability of their viral strains with changing meteorological parameters in parallel to COVID-19 waves were analyzed. Co-circulation of all the four dengue serotypes with rapid change in the pattern of prevalent serotype DENV4 (Genotype-I) in the year 2020 and DENV3 (Genotype-III) in 2021 were observed, in parallel to different circulating strains of COVID-19. Spatiotemporal distribution of DENV using Geographic Information System (GIS) applications observed a serotypic shift and hotspot mapping for risk analysis detected Kolkata as a dengue hotspot, which has also reported the maximum number of COVID-19 cases.

Epistemic and institutional recognition work in changing conditions of social visibility: Anosmia's journey from the shadows to the spotlight.,"This paper explores the complex relationships between recognition, collective action, and social (in)visibility of health conditions. We trace how collective action for recognition changes as conditions of visibility shift. We investigate how the Covid-19 global pandemic thrust one health condition (anosmia) and collective efforts around its recognition from almost complete public invisibility into a sudden spotlight. We show how 'prepared' movement actors leveraged this sudden hypervisibility to mobilize resources and change cultural values, noting how prior 'recognition work' becomes a resource for new ways to advocate for their condition's recognition, toward epistemic and institutional recognition: from building a shared epistemic ground and improving relatability, toward resource distribution and finally, creating and institutionalizing new cultural values through policy change. Our findings highlight organizational efforts to mitigate community tensions and dispersions related to hypervisibility, through boundary and integration work.",,pandemic
Radical hysterectomy case volume and cervical cancer treatment in the era of COVID-19: A multi-site analysis of National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers.,"To compare radical hysterectomy case volume, cancer stage, and biopsy-to-treatment time of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a multi-institution retrospective cohort study conducted at 6 large, geographically diverse National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers, patients treated for newly diagnosed invasive cervical cancer were classified into 2 temporal cohorts based on date of first gynecologic oncology encounter: (1) Pre-Pandemic: 3/1/2018-2/28/2020; (2) Pandemic & Recovery: 4/1/2020-12/31/2021. The primary outcome was total monthly radical hysterectomy case volume. Secondary outcomes were stage at diagnosis and diagnosis-to-treatment time. Statistical analyses used chi-squared and two sample t-tests. Between 3/1/2018-12/31/2021, 561 patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer. The Pre-Pandemic and Pandemic & Recovery cohorts had similar age, race, ethnicity, smoking status, and Body Mass Index (BMI). During Pandemic & Recovery, the mean monthly radical hysterectomy case volume decreased from 7[SD 2.8] to 5[SD 2.0] (p = 0.001), the proportion of patients diagnosed with Stage I disease dropped from 278/561 (49.5%) to 155/381 (40.7%), and diagnosis of stage II-IV disease increased from 281/561 (50.1%) to 224/381 (58.8%). Primary surgical management was less frequent (38.3% Pandemic & Recovery versus 46.7% Pre-Pandemic, p = 0.013) and fewer surgically-treated patients received surgery within 6 weeks of diagnosis (27.4% versus 38.9%; p = 0.025). Lower radical hysterectomy case volume, a shift to higher cervical cancer stage, and delay in surgical therapy were observed across the United States following the COVID-19 outbreak. Decreased surgical volume may result from lower detection of early-stage disease or other factors.",COVID-19;Cervical cancer;Coronavirus;Pandemic;Radical hysterectomy,pandemic
"'Unable to have a proper conversation over the phone about my concerns': a multimethods evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on routine childhood vaccination services in London, UK.","Investigating the completion rate of 12-month vaccinations and parental perspectives on vaccine services during COVID-19. Service evaluation including parental questionnaire. Uptake of 12-month vaccinations in three London general practices during three periods: pre-COVID (1/3/2018-28/2/2019, n = 826), during COVID (1/3/2019-28/2/2020, n = 775) and post-COVID first wave (1/8/2020-31/1/2021, n = 419). Questionnaire of parents whose children were registered at the practices (1/4/2019-1/22/2021, n = 1350). Comparing pre-COVID and both COVID cohorts, the completion rates of 12-month vaccines were lower. Haemophilus influenzae type B/meningococcal group C (Hib/MenC) vaccination uptake was 5.6% lower (89.0% vs 83.4%, P=<0.001), meningococcal group B (MenB) booster uptake was 4.4% lower (87.3% vs 82.9%, P = 0.006), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) booster uptake was 6% lower (88.0% vs 82.0%, P < 0.001) and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake was 5.2% lower (89.1% vs 83.9%, P = 0.003). Black/Black-British ethnicity children had increased odds of missing their 12-month vaccinations compared to White ethnicity children (adjusted odds ratio 0.43 [95% confidence interval 0.24-0.79, P = 0.005; 0.36 [0.20-0.65], P < 0.001; 0.48 [0.27-0.87], P = 0.01; 0.40 [0.22-0.73], P = 0.002; for Hib/MenC, MenB booster, PCV booster and MMR. Comparing pre-COVID and COVID periods, vaccinations coded as not booked increased for MMR (10%), MenB (7%) and PCV booster (8%). Parents reported changes to vaccination services during COVID-19, including difficulties booking and attending appointments and lack of vaccination reminders. A sustained decrease in 12-month childhood vaccination uptake disproportionally affected Black/Black British ethnicity infants during the first wave of the pandemic. Vaccination reminders and availability of healthcare professionals to discuss parental vaccine queries are vital to maintaining uptake.",COVID-19;Childhood vaccinations;Public health;Vaccination services,pandemic
Maternal prenatal social contact during the COVID-19 pandemic predicts infant birth weight.,"Social connectedness and mental health have been associated with infant birth weight, and both were compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine whether changes in maternal prenatal social contact due to the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with infant birth weight and if maternal prenatal mental health mediated this association. A longitudinal study of mothers and their infants born during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 282 United States-based mother-infant dyads. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II, anxiety was measured with the State Anxiety Inventory, and stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale 14. We also asked participants about pandemic-related changes in social contact across various domains. Adjusted birth weight was calculated from birth records or participant-report when birth records were unavailable. Decreases in social contact during the pandemic were associated with lower adjusted infant birth weight (B = 76.82, SE = 35.82, p = .035). This association was mediated by maternal prenatal depressive symptoms [Effect = 15.06, 95 % CI (0.19, 35.58)] but not by prenatal anxiety [95 % CI (-0.02, 32.38)] or stress [95 % CI (-0.31, 26.19)]. These findings highlight concerns for both mothers and infants in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, since birth weight can have long-term health implications and the social restructuring occasioned by the pandemic may lead to lasting changes in social behavior.",Adjusted birth weight;Coronavirus;Maternal;Mental health;Perinatal;Social support,pandemic
Relationship between COVID-related stressors and internalizing symptoms: Gendered neuroendocrine risk profiles.,"The COVID-19 pandemic generated significant life stress and increases in internalizing disorders. Moreover, COVID-related stressors disproportionately impacted women, consistent with outcomes showing a gender gap in stress-related disorders. Gender-related stress vulnerability emerges in adolescence alongside gender-specific changes in neuroendocrine signaling. Most research on the neuroendocrinology of stress-related disorders has focused on differences in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effector hormone cortisol. More recent studies, however, emphasize dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a neuroprotective and neuroactive hormone released concurrently with cortisol that balances its biobehavioral actions during stress. Notably, women show lower cortisol responses and higher DHEA responses to stress. However, lower cortisol and higher DHEA are associated with internalizing disorders in women, while those associations are opposite in men. Thus, gender-specific factors perhaps result in a neuroendocrine profile that places women at greater risk for stress-related disorders. The current study prospectively examined socially evaluated cold-pressor task (SECPT) induced neuroendocrine responses at age 15 and internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic at age 21 in a cohort of 175 primarily Black low-socioeconomic status participants, while controlling for internalizing symptoms at age 15. The association between COVID-related stress and internalizing symptoms was not stronger in women. Lower DHEA-cortisol ratios were associated with a weaker relationship between COVID-related stress and internalizing symptoms in women, while higher ratios were associated with a weaker relationship in men. These findings suggest gender differences in the relationship between DHEA and cortisol and internalizing outcomes during a stressful period, and support differential neuroendocrine protective and risk pathways for young men and women.",COVID-19 pandemic;Gender differences;HPA axis;Internalizing symptoms;Stress,pandemic
"Burnout, Moral Distress, and Compassion Fatigue as Correlates of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms in Clinical and Nonclinical Healthcare Workers.","Research has highlighted psychological distress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers (HCWs), including the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, the degree to which these conditions have endured beyond the pandemic and the extent to which they affect the entire healthcare team, including both clinical and nonclinical workers, remain unknown. This study aims to identify correlates of PTSS in the entire healthcare workforce with the goal of providing evidence to support the development of trauma-informed leadership strategies. Data were collected from June to July 2022 using a cross-sectional anonymous survey in a large academic medical center setting. A total of 6,466 clinical and nonclinical employees completed the survey (27.3% response rate). Cases with at least one missing variable were omitted, for a total sample size of 4,806, the evaluation of which enabled us to understand individual, organizational, and work-related and nonwork-related stressors associated with PTSS. Data were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression and dominance analyses to identify predictors of PTSS specific to clinical and nonclinical workers. While previous studies have shown that HCWs in different job roles experience unique stressors, our data indicate that the top correlates of PTSS among both clinical and nonclinical HCWs are the same: burnout, moral distress, and compassion fatigue. These three factors alone explained 45% and 44.4% of the variance in PTSS in clinical and nonclinical workers, respectively. PTSS was also associated with a lower sense of recognition and feeling mistreated by other employees at work in the clinical workforce. Concerningly, women and sexual minorities in the clinical sample exhibited a higher incidence of PTSS. In nonclinical workers, social isolation or loneliness and lower trust and confidence in senior leadership were associated with PTSS. Nonwork-related factors, such as exhaustion from caregiving responsibilities and financial strain, were also significantly associated with PTSS. Even after controlling for discrimination at and outside of work in both samples, we found that non-White populations were more likely to experience PTSS, highlighting a deeply concerning issue in the healthcare workforce. The primary objective of this article is to help healthcare leaders understand the correlates of PTSS across the entire healthcare team as organizations recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding which factors are associated with PTSS will help healthcare leaders develop best practices that aim to reduce HCW distress and strategies to circumvent trauma derived from future crises. Our data indicate that leaders must address the correlates of PTSS in the workforce, focusing attention on both those who work on the frontlines and those who work behind the scenes. We urge leaders to adopt a trauma-informed leadership approach to ensure that the entire healthcare workforce is recognized, supported, and cared for as each HCW plays a unique role in the care of patients.",,pandemic
Ludwig's Angina: Higher Incidence and Worse Outcomes Associated With the Onset of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,"Ludwig's angina (LA) is a diffuse cellulitis of the submandibular space and adjacent tissues. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, odontogenic treatments were often delayed because of the implementation of safety measures to avoid the spread of the virus. We hypothesized that delayed odontogenic treatments associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic would be associated with an increase in the incidence of LA and worse outcomes related to these infections.  Patients from June 2018 to June 2022 with computed tomography images suggestive of LA and confirmed by ear, nose, throat (ENT) consult were included. We abstracted demographics, outcomes, clinical management, and microbiology. Patients were stratified into pre-COVID and COVID-onset. Our primary outcome, incidence of LA, was defined as: (new LA cases) ÷ (ED evaluations of oral or dental infections × 1.5 years).  In the pre-COVID group, we identified 32 of 1,301 patients with LA for an incidence of 0.02 per year. The COVID-onset group consisted of 41 of 641 patients, with an incidence of 0.04 per year. In the COVID-onset group, progression to necrotizing fasciitis was more likely (0% vs. 15%; p < 0.024), and they returned to the operating room for repeated debridement (3% vs. 22%; p < 0.020). Likewise, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and ventilator days were higher (4.3 ± 3.5 vs. 9.5 ± 11.3; 1.1 ± 1.2 vs. 9.5 ± 7.1; 0.3 ± 1 vs. 3.6 ± 7.1; p < 0.001).  Although the prognosis for dental infections diagnosed early is generally favorable, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of LA after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, complications stemming from these infections became more severe in the COVID-onset era. Specifically, the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis showed a substantial increase, accompanied by an increased risk of respiratory failure and mediastinitis.",COVID-19;Ludwig's angina;incidence;outcomes,pandemic
Open science discovery of potent noncovalent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.,"We report the results of the COVID Moonshot, a fully open-science, crowdsourced, and structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease. We discovered a noncovalent, nonpeptidic inhibitor scaffold with lead-like properties that is differentiated from current main protease inhibitors. Our approach leveraged crowdsourcing, machine learning, exascale molecular simulations, and high-throughput structural biology and chemistry. We generated a detailed map of the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, extensive structure-activity relationships for multiple chemotypes, and a wealth of biochemical activity data. All compound designs (>18,000 designs), crystallographic data (>490 ligand-bound x-ray structures), assay data (>10,000 measurements), and synthesized molecules (>2400 compounds) for this campaign were shared rapidly and openly, creating a rich, open, and intellectual property-free knowledge base for future anticoronavirus drug discovery.",,pandemic

The effects of COVID-19 mitigation measures on physical activity (PA) participation among adults in Rwanda: An online cross-sectional survey.,"More than a third of the world's population was under full or partial lockdown during COVID-19 by April 2020. Such mitigation measures might have affected participation in various Physical activity (PA) and increased sedentary time. This study aimed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 mitigation measures on participation of adults in various PA types in Rwanda. We collected data from conveniently selected participants at their respective PA sites. We assessed the variation in time spent doing in four types of PA (Work related PA, PA in and around home, transportation PA and recreation, sport, and leisure purpose) across different pandemic period. We also evaluated the sedentary time over the weekdays and on the weekends. A total of 1136 participants completed online assisted questionnaire. 71.4% were male, 83% of the study participants aged 18 to 35 years (mean = 29, (standard deviation = 7.79). Mean time spent doing vigorous PA as part of the work dropped from 84.5 minutes per day before COVID-19 to 58.6 minutes per day during lockdown and went back to 81.5 minutes per day after the lockdown. Time spent sitting on weekdays increased from 163 before COVID-19 to 244.5 minutes during lockdown and to 166.8 minutes after lockdown. Sitting time on weekend increased from 150 before COVID-19 to 235 minutes during lockdown and to 151 minutes after lockdown. Sleeping time on weekdays increased from 7.5 hours per day before COVID-19 to 9.9 hours during lockdown and to 7.5 hours after lockdown while it increased from 8 hours before COVID-19 to 10 hours during lockdown and to 8 hours per day after lockdown during weekends. The study emphasizes the significance of diverse PA, including home-based programs, during pandemics like COVID-19. It suggests promoting PA types like work-related, transportation, and domestic works during lockdown and similar period.",,pandemic
A systematic review of the clinical profile of patients with bubonic plague and the outcome measures used in research settings.,"Plague is a zoonotic disease that, despite affecting humans for more than 5000 years, has historically been the subject of limited drug development activity. Drugs that are currently recommended in treatment guidelines have been approved based on animal studies alone-no pivotal clinical trials in humans have yet been completed. As a result of the sparse clinical research attention received, there are a number of methodological challenges that need to be addressed in order to facilitate the collection of clinical trial data that can meaningfully inform clinicians and policy-makers. One such challenge is the identification of clinically-relevant endpoints, which are informed by understanding the clinical characterisation of the disease-how it presents and evolves over time, and important patient outcomes, and how these can be modified by treatment. This systematic review aims to summarise the clinical profile of 1343 patients with bubonic plague described in 87 publications, identified by searching bibliographic databases for studies that meet pre-defined eligibility criteria. The majority of studies were individual case reports. A diverse group of signs and symptoms were reported at baseline and post-baseline timepoints-the most common of which was presence of a bubo, for which limited descriptive and longitudinal information was available. Death occurred in 15% of patients; although this varied from an average 10% in high-income countries to an average 17% in low- and middle-income countries. The median time to death was 1 day, ranging from 0 to 16 days. This systematic review elucidates the restrictions that limited disease characterisation places on clinical trials for infectious diseases such as plague, which not only impacts the definition of trial endpoints but has the knock-on effect of challenging the interpretation of a trial's results. For this reason and despite interventional trials for plague having taken place, questions around optimal treatment for plague persist.",,pandemic
A stochastic programming approach to perform hospital capacity assessments.,"This article introduces a bespoke risk averse stochastic programming approach for performing a strategic level assessment of hospital capacity (QAHC). We include stochastic treatment durations and length of stay in the analysis for the first time. To the best of our knowledge this is a new capability, not yet provided in the literature. Our stochastic programming approach identifies the maximum caseload that can be treated over a specified duration of time subject to a specified risk threshold in relation to temporary exceedances of capacity. Sample averaging techniques are applied to handle probabilistic constraints, but due to the size and complexity of the resultant mixed integer programming model, a novel two-stage hierarchical solution approach is needed. Our two-stage hierarchical solution approach is novel as it combines the application of a meta-heuristic with a binary search. It is also computationally fast. A case study of a large public hospital has been considered and extensive numerical tests have been undertaken to highlight the nuances and intricacies of the analysis. We conclude that the proposed approach is effective and can provide extra clarity and insights around hospital outputs. It provides a way to better calibrate hospitals and other health care infrastructure to future demands and challenges, like those created by the COVID pandemic.",,pandemic
"Inequality and COVID-19 in Sweden: Relative risks of nine bad life events, by four social gradients, in pandemic vs. prepandemic years.","The COVID-19 pandemic struck societies directly and indirectly, not just challenging population health but disrupting many aspects of life. Different effects of the spreading virus-and the measures to fight it-are reported and discussed in different scientific fora, with hard-to-compare methods and metrics from different traditions. While the pandemic struck some groups more than others, it is difficult to assess the comprehensive impact on social inequalities. This paper gauges social inequalities using individual-level administrative data for Sweden's entire population. We describe and analyze the relative risks for different social groups in four dimensions-gender, education, income, and world region of birth-to experience three types of COVID-19 incidence, as well as six additional negative life outcomes that reflect general health, access to medical care, and economic strain. During the pandemic, the overall population faced severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and saw higher all-cause mortality, income losses and unemployment risks, as well as reduced access to medical care. These burdens fell more heavily on individuals with low income or education and on immigrants. Although these vulnerable groups experienced larger absolute risks of suffering the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic, the relative risks in pandemic years (2020 and 2021) were conspicuously similar to those in prepandemic years (2016 to 2019).",COVID-19 pandemic;multidimensional inequality;pandemic vs. prepandemic inequality;social gradients,pandemic
Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Analysis of the HERO Registry.,"Little is known about the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare workers (HCWs). Past literature has shown that chronic strain caused by pandemics can adversely impact a variety of mental health outcomes in HCWs. There is growing recognition of the risk of stress and loss of resilience to HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic remains poorly understood. We wanted to understand the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of PTDS symptoms in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed 2038 health care workers enrolled in the Healthcare Worker Exposure Response & Outcomes (HERO) study, which is a large standardized national registry of health care workers. Participants answered questions about demographics, COVID-19 exposure, job burnout, and PTSD symptoms. We characterize the burden of PTSD symptoms among HCWs, and determined the association between high PTSD symptoms and race, gender, professional role, work setting, and geographic region using multivariable regression. In a fully adjusted model, we found that older HCWs were less likely to report high PTSD symptoms compared with younger HCWs. Additionally, we found that physicians were less likely to report high PTSD symptoms compared with nurses. These data add to the growing literature on increased risks of mental health challenges to healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,pandemic
COVID-19 as WATER? The functions of WATER metaphors in the metaphorical representation of COVID-19.,"Previous studies have examined WATER metaphors in different discourses, yet there has been limited focus on understanding the functions of these metaphors in constructing discourses. To address this research gap, the present paper utilised the metaphor identification procedure developed by the Pragglejaz Group and the Weak Differentiating Model to investigate WATER metaphors in the Coronavirus Corpus. The study reveals that WATER metaphors can be used flexibly for multiple purposes. These include explaining the many pandemic stages, describing the occurrence and performance of the pandemic, explaining how COVID-19 affects human life, rallying the public to take precautions against contagion, and communicating risk. This research highlights the diverse functions that WATER metaphors served in conveying intricate information and influencing public perceptions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.",,pandemic
"An Exploratory Qualitative Analysis of Explanations for COVID-19-Related Racial Disparities Among St. Louis Residents: ""I Don't Really Pay Attention to the Racial Stuff Very Much"".","Public health explanations for the disproportionate share of COVID-19-related illness and death among the Black population often differ from lay explanations, which can affect the public's support for policies that address these disparities. This qualitative exploratory study examined the explanatory frameworks for COVID-19-related racial disparities in St. Louis among 54 St. Louis residents. From August 16, 2021, through May 20, 2022, we conducted semistructured interviews among a convenience sample of 54 St. Louis residents about their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Directed content analysis identified participants' explanatory frameworks for racial disparities in COVID-19-related illness and death. We disaggregated coded excerpts by race, age, education, and income to examine emerging themes. Lay explanatory frameworks for racial disparities in COVID-19 included vaccine mistrust, lack of personal responsibility, low perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, pre-existing conditions or genetic predisposition, institutional racism, barriers to care, low socioeconomic status, insufficient information on COVID-19, and the inability to work remotely. Black interview participants addressed issues of systemic racism, inequitable allocation of COVID-19 vaccines, and institutional mistrust, whereas White participants did not directly acknowledge the role of racism. Both Black and White participants identified lack of personal responsibility among young Black people as a source of these disparities. This work identifies a need for improved health communication about racial disparities in COVID-19-related illness and death. Messaging that highlights racism may be less effective among the White population than the Black population in the US, whereas narratives that include the theme of individual choice may appeal broadly. Further research is needed on the use of communication strategies based on lay individuals' explanatory frameworks for COVID-19-related racial disparities to enhance support for equitable public policy.",,pandemic
Perceptions of hospital care for persons with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic: a social media sentiment analysis.,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to many hospital service disruptions and strict visitor restrictions that impacted care of older adult populations. This study investigates perceptions of hospital care for persons with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic as shared on Reddit's social media platform. This study combined an opinion mining framework with linguistic processing to conduct a sentiment analysis of word clusters and care-based content in a sample of 1205 posts shared between February 2020 and March 2023 in Reddit's English-language corpus. Data were classified based on reoccurring contiguous sequences of two words from our text sample. Hospital dementia care discourse on Reddit advanced four negative sentiment themes: (1) fear of poor medication management, hydration, and hygiene, (2) loss of patient advocacy, (3) precipitation of advance directive discussions, and (4) delayed discharge and loss of nursing home bed. One positive sentiment theme also emerged: gratitude towards hospital staff. Negative sentiment Reddit posts constituted a larger share of the posts than positive posts regarding hospital care for persons with dementia. People who posted about their experiences shared their concerns about hospital care deficiencies and the importance of including informal caregivers in hospital settings, particularly in the context of a pandemic. Implications exist for dementia training, improved quality of care, advance care planning and transitions in care policies.",Alzheimer disease;Opinion mining;caregivers;geriatrics,pandemic
"Progress Toward Eradication of Dracunculiasis - Worldwide, January 2022-June 2023.","The effort to eradicate Dracunculus medinensis, the etiologic agent of dracunculiasis, or Guinea worm disease, commenced at CDC in 1980. In 1986, with an estimated 3.5 million cases worldwide in 20 African and Asian countries, the World Health Assembly called for dracunculiasis elimination. The Guinea Worm Eradication Program (GWEP) was established to help countries with endemic dracunculiasis reach this goal. GWEP is led by The Carter Center and supported by partners that include the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and CDC. In 2012, D. medinensis infections were unexpectedly confirmed in Chadian dogs, and since then, infections in dogs, cats, and baboons have posed a new challenge for GWEP, as have ongoing civil unrest and insecurity in some areas. By 2022, dracunculiasis was endemic in five countries (Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan), with only 13 human cases identified, the lowest yearly total ever reported. Animal infections, however, were not declining at the same rate: 686 animal infections were reported in 2022, including 606 (88%) in dogs in Chad. Despite these unanticipated challenges as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, countries appear close to reaching the eradication goal. GWEP will continue working with country programs to address animal infections, civil unrest, and insecurity, that challenge the eradication of Guinea worm.",,pandemic
"Coverage with Selected Vaccines and Exemption from School Vaccine Requirements Among Children in Kindergarten - United States, 2022-23 School Year.","U.S. states and local jurisdictions set vaccination requirements for school attendance and conditions and procedures for exemptions from these requirements. States annually report data to CDC on the number of children in kindergarten who meet, are exempt from, or are in the process of meeting requirements. National- and state-level estimates for complete vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR); diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP); poliovirus vaccine (polio); and varicella vaccine (VAR); exemptions from vaccination; and legally allowed kindergarten attendance while meeting requirements were based on data reported by 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) for the 2022-23 school year. This kindergarten class became age-eligible to complete most state-required vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. National coverage remained near 93% for all vaccines; exemptions were low but increased to 3%, compared with those during the 2021-22 school year (2.6%). At the state level, coverage with MMR, DTaP, polio, and VAR decreased in 29, 31, 28, and 25 states, respectively, compared with coverage during the 2021-22 school year. Exemptions increased in 40 states and DC, with 10 states reporting an exemption from at least one vaccine for >5% of kindergartners. Schools and providers should work to ensure that students are vaccinated before school entry, such as during the enrollment process, which is often several months before school starts. State and local provisional enrollment periods that allow students to attend school while on a catch-up schedule also provide the opportunity to fully vaccinate students and to prevent nonmedical exemptions resulting from lingering undervaccination due to COVID-19 pandemic-related barriers to vaccination, such as reduced access to vaccination appointments.",,pandemic

"The Deceased, Public Health, and Research: Proposing Legal Reforms.","There is little guidance concerning biomedical research using tissues from deceased individuals. Unique ethical and legal challenges gained visibility during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when important studies using genome sequencing required access to biological materials from deceased individuals. These studies proposed to determine whether specific genomic profiles were associated with important disease outcomes. Such research has previously required consent from next-of-kin or other surrogate decision makers. Ethics waivers for such consent vary within Canada. In Ontario, research ethics boards can grant waivers of consent if the Tri-Council Policy Statement-2 conditions are met. These include that the individual is not harmed, that the materials are essential to the research, and that privacy will be protected. Conversely, in Quebec, Civil Code article 22 imposes an obligation on researchers to seek consent from next-of-kin or another surrogate decision maker with no option for waivers. It became evident to researchers that these standards can sometimes impose an impracticable balance of risks and benefits, especially in public health emergencies.

We aimed to find a solution for increasing blood donations and provide a scientific reference for policy formulation regarding blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future. A random survey with a 14-item scale on worries related to blood donation was conducted from December 31, 2022, to January 3, 2023, among residents aged 18-60 years in Zhejiang province via SMS text messaging. The results of 8 worry items in this study were compared with the survey results of March 2022, during which COVID-19 was not considered as an epidemic in Zhejiang province. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were performed to analyze the factors affecting respondents' blood donation intention and concerns. The degree of worry about blood donation was assigned from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree), and 2-sided t tests were performed to analyze the differences in blood donation intention and worries about blood donation. In total, 1254 valid questionnaire responses were obtained. Males accounted for 62.36% (782/1254) of the sample, 78.39% (983/1254) were 18-45 years old, 60.61% (760/1254) had a university education, and 69.06% (866/1254) had no previous blood donation experience. Approximately 36.52% (458/1254) of the public clearly expressed that they had blood donation worries regarding COVID-19. The main concerns of the respondents were temporary physical weakness caused by blood donation, their own physical conditions not meeting the requirements of blood donation, inconvenient location and working hours for blood donation, and family (or friends) worrying about blood donation. Compared with the results in 2022, the results in 2023 regarding the harmful effects of blood donation on health, temporary physical weakness, infection in donated blood, and family (friends) worrying increased significantly (P<.001). The factors influencing blood donation worries regarding COVID-19 were COVID-19 infection status, adverse reactions to the donated blood, family (or friends) worrying, and unsatisfactory blood donation experience. The factors influencing blood donation intention were gender, age, previous blood donation times, blood donation worries regarding COVID-19, harmful effects of blood donation on health, and blood donation anxiety. Blood transfusion services should make full use of the recovery phase of COVID-19 infection as an important time point, publicize the blood donation process and operation standardization, reduce the public's concerns about blood donation, correct negative evaluations, and increase perceived behavioral control and subjective norms.",D008297:Male;D006801:Humans;D000293:Adolescent;D055815:Young Adult;D000328:Adult;D008875:Middle Aged;D000094345:Blood Donation;D000086382:COVID-19;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D058873:Pandemics;D001007:Anxiety,pandemic
Use of Immersive Virtual Reality Spaces to Engage Adolescent and Young Adult Patients With Cancer in Therapist-Guided Support Groups: Protocol for a Pre-Post Study.,"For adolescents and young adults, a cancer diagnoses can magnify feelings of social isolation at an inherently vulnerable developmental stage. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of peer groups during cancer treatment. Support groups help foster connection and resilience, but patients find in-person participation difficult due to a variety of factors. Additionally, physical changes brought on by cancer makes these patients hesitant to meet in person. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these difficulties. Virtual reality (VR) allows for the creation of a therapist-curated, computer-generated social space that potentially enables support groups for this population. This protocol describes a pilot study examining the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a social VR support group intervention for adolescent and young adult patients with cancer. We approached 20 participants aged 17-20 years, and 16 agreed to participate. Moreover, 1 participant dropped out due to hospitalization. Participants attended virtual, professionally facilitated support groups using Meta Quest VR headsets. The groups consisted of 4 participants and 1 facilitator, amounting to a total of 22 individual sessions. Each session lasted 45-60 minutes and took place weekly for 4-6 weeks. The primary aim of this study was to collect quantitative and qualitative data on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Feasibility was measured through session participation rates and overall retention rates. The acceptability of the intervention was explored through brief in-person interviews with participants at the end of the final intervention session. The secondary aim of this study was to collect data on the preliminary efficacy of the intervention in decreasing symptoms of participant depression and anxiety and increasing positive affect and resiliency. In total, 15 patients aged 17-20 years participated in 22 sessions between November 5, 2019, and July 8, 2021. The median age was 19 (IQR 17-20) years. Overall, 10 (62%) participants identified as male, 5 (31%) as female, and 1 (6%) as transgender female. Furthermore, 5 (31%) participants identified as Hispanic, 1 (6%) identified as non-Hispanic Asian, 3 (19%) identified as non-Hispanic Black, 6 (38%) identified as non-Hispanic White, and 1 (6%) identified as other race or ethnicity. Hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure was the most common diagnosis (8/16, 50%). The mean attendance rate was 72.8% (SD 25.7%) and retention was 86.7% (SD 0.35%). Moreover, 45% (10/22) of sessions had to be postponed by a week or more due to unexpected participant scheduling issues. The use of VR to deliver psychosocial support for adolescents and young adults with cancer may reduce common barriers associated with attending in-person peer support groups while improving quality-of-life measures. The data from this study will inform future studies focused on conducting VR support groups in other rare disease populations, including older adults with cancer.

Moving Forward With Telehealth in Cancer Rehabilitation: Patient Perspectives From a Mixed Methods Study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of telehealth in cancer care and highlighted the potential of telehealth as a means of delivering the much-needed rehabilitation services for patients living with the side effects of cancer and its treatments. This mixed methods study aims to explore patients' experiences of telehealth and their preferences regarding the use of telehealth for cancer rehabilitation to inform service development. The study was completed in 2 phases from October 2020 to November 2021. In phase 1, an anonymous survey (web- and paper-based) exploring the need, benefits, barriers, facilitators, and preferences for telehealth cancer rehabilitation was distributed to survivors of cancer in Ireland. In phase 2, survivors of cancer were invited to participate in semistructured interviews exploring their experiences of telehealth and its role in cancer rehabilitation. Interviews were conducted via telephone or video call following an interview guide informed by the results of the survey and transcribed verbatim, and reflexive thematic analysis was performed using a qualitative descriptive approach. A total of 48 valid responses were received. The respondents were at a median of 26 (range 3-256) months after diagnosis, and 23 (48%) of the 48 participants had completed treatment. Of the 48 respondents, 31 (65%) reported using telehealth since the start of the pandemic, 15 (31%) reported having experience with web-based cancer rehabilitation, and 43 (90%) reported a willingness for web-based cancer rehabilitation. A total of 26 (54%) of the 48 respondents reported that their views on telehealth had changed positively since the start of the pandemic. Semistructured interviews were held with 18 survivors of cancer. The mean age of the participants was 58.9 (SD 8.24) years, 56% (10/18) of the participants were female, and 44% (8/18) of the participants were male. Reflexive thematic analysis identified 5 key themes: telehealth improves accessibility to cancer rehabilitation for some but is a barrier for others, lived experiences of the benefits of telehealth in survivorship, the value of in-person health care, telehealth in cancer care and COVID-19 (from novelty to normality), and the future of telehealth in cancer rehabilitation. Telehealth is broadly welcomed as a mode of cancer rehabilitation for patients living with and beyond cancer in Ireland. However, issues regarding accessibility and the importance of in-person care must be acknowledged. Factors of convenience, time savings, and cost savings indicate that telehealth interventions are a desirable patient-centered method of delivering care when performed in suitable clinical contexts and with appropriate populations.",cancer rehabilitation;mixed methods;mobile phone;oncology;qualitative;telehealth;telemedicine,pandemic
Developing an Audit and Feedback Dashboard for Family Physicians: User-Centered Design Process.,"Audit and feedback (A&F), the summary and provision of clinical performance data, is a common quality improvement strategy. Successful design and implementation of A&F-or any quality improvement strategy-should incorporate evidence-informed best practices as well as context-specific end user input. We used A&F theory and user-centered design to inform the development of a web-based primary care A&F dashboard. We describe the design process and how it influenced the design of the dashboard. Our design process included 3 phases: prototype development based on A&F theory and input from clinical improvement leaders; workshop with family physician quality improvement leaders to develop personas (ie, fictional users that represent an archetype character representative of our key users) and application of those personas to design decisions; and user-centered interviews with family physicians to learn about the physician's reactions to the revised dashboard. The team applied A&F best practices to the dashboard prototype. Personas were used to identify target groups with challenges and behaviors as a tool for informed design decision-making. Our workshop produced 3 user personas, Dr Skeptic, Frazzled Physician, and Eager Implementer, representing common users based on the team's experience of A&F. Interviews were conducted to further validate findings from the persona workshop and found that (1) physicians were interested in how they compare with peers; however, if performance was above average, they were not motivated to improve even if gaps compared to other standards in their care remained; (2) burnout levels were high as physicians are trying to catch up on missed care during the pandemic and are therefore less motivated to act on the data; and (3) additional desired features included integration within the electronic medical record, and more up-to-date and accurate data. We found that carefully incorporating data from user interviews helped operationalize generic best practices for A&F to achieve an acceptable dashboard that could meet the needs and goals of physicians. We demonstrate such a design process in this paper. A&F dashboards should address physicians' data skepticism, present data in a way that spurs action, and support physicians to have the time and capacity to engage in quality improvement work; the steps we followed may help those responsible for quality improvement strategy implementation achieve these aims.","D006801:Humans;D010821:Physicians, Family;D005246:Feedback;D000086825:User-Centered Design;D007858:Learning;D000077062:Burnout, Psychological",pandemic
Assessment of Changes in Cancer Treatment During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US.,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to disruptions in access to health care, including cancer care. The extent of changes in receipt of cancer treatment is unclear. To evaluate changes in the absolute number, proportion, and cancer treatment modalities provided to patients with newly diagnosed cancer during 2020, the first year of the pandemic. In this cohort study, adults aged 18 years and older diagnosed with any solid tumor between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020, were identified using the National Cancer Database. Data analysis was conducted from September 19, 2022, to July 28, 2023. First year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The expected number of procedures for each treatment modality (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy) in 2020 were calculated using historical data (January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019) with the vector autoregressive method. The difference between expected and observed numbers was evaluated using a generalized estimating equation under assumptions of the Poisson distribution for count data. Changes in the proportion of different types of cancer treatments initiated in 2020 were evaluated using the additive outlier method. A total of 3 504 342 patients (1 214 918 in 2018, mean [SD] age, 64.6 [13.6] years; 1 235 584 in 2019, mean [SD] age, 64.8 [13.6] years; and 1 053 840 in 2020, mean [SD] age, 64.9 [13.6] years) were included. Compared with expected treatment from previous years' trends, there were approximately 98 000 fewer curative intent surgical procedures performed, 38 800 fewer chemotherapy regimens, 55 500 fewer radiotherapy regimens, 6800 fewer immunotherapy regimens, and 32 000 fewer hormonal therapies initiated in 2020. For most cancer sites and stages evaluated, there was no statistically significant change in the type of cancer treatment provided during the first year of the pandemic, the exception being a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of patients receiving breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy with a simultaneous statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients undergoing mastectomy for treatment of stage I breast cancer during the first months of the pandemic. In this large national cohort study, a significant deficit was noted in the number of cancer treatments provided in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data indicated that this deficit in the number of cancer treatments provided was associated with decreases in the number of cancer diagnoses, not changes in treatment strategies.",,pandemic
Psychobiological effects of an eHealth psychoeducational intervention to informal caregivers of persons with dementia: a pilot study during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.,"The workload associated with caring for a person with dementia (PwD) could negatively affect informal caregivers' physical and mental health. According to the recent literature, there is a need for studies testing the implementation of affordable and accessible interventions for improving caregivers' well-being. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of an 8 week eHealth psychoeducation intervention held during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy in reducing the psychological burden and neuroendocrine markers of stress in caregivers of PwD. Forty-one informal caregivers of PwD completed the eHealth psychoeducation intervention. Self-reported (i.e., caregiver burden, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and caregiver self-efficacy) and cortisol measurements were collected before and after the intervention. Following the intervention, the caregivers' self-efficacy regarding the ability to respond to disruptive behaviours improved (t = - 2.817, p = 0.007), anxiety and burden levels decreased (state anxiety: t = 3.170, p = 0.003; trait anxiety: t = 2.327, p = 0.025; caregiver burden: t = 2.290, p = 0.027), while depressive symptoms and cortisol levels did not change significantly. Correlation analyses showed that the increase in self-efficacy was positively associated with the improvement of caregiver burden from pre- to post-intervention (r = 0.386, p = 0.014). The intervention had a low rate of dropout (n = 1, due to the patient's death) and high levels of appreciation. The positive evidence and participation rate support the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed eHealth psychoeducational intervention to meet the need for knowledge of disease management and possibly reduce detrimental effects on caregivers' psychological well-being. Further placebo-controlled trials are needed to test the generalizability and specificity of our results.",Caregiver burden;Caregivers;Cortisol;Dementia;Psychoeducation;Self-efficacy,pandemic
A Qualitative Investigation of the Experiences of Women with Perinatal Depression and Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on maternal mental health. We explored the lived experiences of women with perinatal depression and anxiety to elucidate their perceptions of how the pandemic influenced their mental health and access to care. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews. From March to October 2021, purposive sampling was used to recruit a socio-demographically diverse sample of women with self-reported perinatal depression or anxiety who were pregnant or within one year postpartum between March 2020 and October 2021. Interviews were conducted remotely and thematically analyzed. Fourteen women were interviewed. Three major themes arose. Theme 1, Negative impacts of COVID-19 on symptoms of depression and anxiety, described how the pandemic magnified underlying symptoms of depression and anxiety, increased social isolation, generated anxiety due to fears of COVID-19 infection, and caused economic stress. In theme 2, Negative impacts of COVID-19 on access to and quality of health care, women described stressful and isolating delivery experiences, negative psychological impact of partners not being able to participate in their perinatal health care, interruptions and barriers to mental health treatment, and challenges in using telehealth services for mental health care. Theme 3, Positive impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, identified advantages of increased telehealth access and ability to work and study from home. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected women with perinatal depression and anxiety by magnifying underlying symptoms, increasing stress and social isolation, and disrupting access to mental health care. Findings provide support for policies and interventions to prevent and address social isolation, as well as optimization of telehealth services to prevent and address gaps in perinatal mental health treatment.",COVID-19;Maternal Health;Perinatal Depression;Qualitative Research;Social Support,pandemic
Beyond the acute illness: Exploring long COVID and its impact on multiple organ systems.,"Unprecedented worldwide health catastrophe due to the COVID-19 pandemic has ended up resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. Even though many people recover from acute infection, there is rising concern regarding post-COVID-19 conditions (PCCs), often referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or ""long COVID."" The respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrine systems are just a few of the many organ systems that can be impacted by this multifarious, complicated illness. The clinical manifestations of long COVID can vary among individuals and may include fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive impairment, and new-onset diabetes, among others. Although the underlying processes of long COVID are not fully understood, they probably involve unregulated immune response, persistent generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (chronic inflammation), autoimmune-like reactions, persistent viral replication, and micro-clot formation. To create successful treatments and care plans, it is essential to comprehend the immunological mechanisms causing these difficulties. The pathogenesis of long COVID should be clarified and potential biomarkers to help with diagnosis and treatment should be sought after. To reduce the burden of long COVID on people and healthcare systems around the world, the need for long-term monitoring and management of long COVID problems should be emphasized. It also underscores the significance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. The goal of this review is to carefully evaluate the clinical signs and symptoms of long COVID, their underlying causes, and any potential immunological implications.",SARS-CoV-2;long COVID;multiple organ systems;pandemic;post-COVID-19 conditions,pandemic
Telemedicine Versus Teledermatology Usage and Perception Among US-Based Physicians: A Survey Study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an increase in focus and use of telemedicine in several patient care settings. This survey study was distributed to actively practicing US-based physicians and examines telehealth use 2 years after the beginning of the COVID pandemic from a physician&rsquo;s perspective. Notable findings include telehealth benefits which include increased patient access and the ability to work from home. A continued drawback in telehealth visits is the limitations on a complete physical examination, a drawback that was emphasized by the dermatology community. While this study sheds light on the developing nature of telehealth, it is limited by its retrospective nature and sample size. Future research with larger sample sizes focusing on economic incentives and telemedicine training may help to overcome barriers to using telehealth.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(11):e4-e8&nbsp; &nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7386e.",D006801:Humans;D058873:Pandemics;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D010820:Physicians;D017216:Telemedicine;D010465:Perception,pandemic
Perceived Barriers to Career Advancement: Medical Students and Resident Physicians.,"The path to becoming a physician is challenging, with various barriers influencing medical student and resident physician residency and fellowship training career decisions. Studies comparing perceived obstacles at disparate training levels are limited and given these obstacles are dynamic, studies are frequently needed to evaluate perceived barriers to pursuing residency specialty or fellowship of interest for physician trainees. To evaluate and compare perceived barriers to obtaining residency specialty or fellowship of choice for medical students and resident physicians, respectively. A Likert scale survey assessing perceived barriers was administered via the listservs of medical schools and organizations in 2021. Differences in the Likert scale score mean between medical students and resident physicians were measured with student t-tests (2-sided). A total of 404 medical trainees participated (301 medical students and 103 resident physicians). Medical students indicated lack of opportunity to obtain alpha omega alpha membership as the most crucial perceived barrier (mean Likert scale score &plusmn; standard deviation, 4.01&plusmn;1.97), followed by USMLE Step 1 score (3.92&plusmn;1.89) and lack of home program in specialty/fellowship of interest (3.62&plusmn;1.85). Similarly, resident physicians implicated the lack of a home program in a specialty/fellowship of interest as the most prominent barrier (3.48&plusmn;1.78), followed by lack of connections/networking (3.17&plusmn;1.50) and probability of matching (3.14&plusmn;1.44). The lack of a home program was an important barrier to pursuing a specialty or fellowship of choice for both medical students and resident physicians, respectively, and may have been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Human mRNA in saliva can correctly identify individuals harboring acute infection.,"The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the poor ability of body temperature to reliably identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, an observation that has been made before in the context of other infectious diseases. While acute infection does not always cause fever, it does reliably drive host transcriptional responses as the body responds at the site of infection. These transcriptional changes can occur both in cells that are directly harboring replicating pathogens and in cells elsewhere that receive a molecular signal that infection is occurring. Here, we identify a core set of approximately 70 human genes that are together upregulated in cultured human cells infected by a broad array of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. We have named these ""core response"" genes. In theory, transcripts from these genes could serve as biomarkers of infection in the human body, in a way that is agnostic to the specific pathogen causing infection. As such, we perform human studies to show that these infection-induced human transcripts can be measured in the saliva of people harboring different types of infections. The number of these transcripts in saliva can correctly classify infection status (whether a person harbors an infection) 91% of the time. Furthermore, in the case of SARS-CoV-2 specifically, the number of core response transcripts in saliva correctly identifies infectious individuals even when enrollees, themselves, are asymptomatic and do not know they are infected.IMPORTANCEThere are a variety of clinical and laboratory criteria available to clinicians in controlled healthcare settings to help them identify whether an infectious disease is present. However, in situations such as a new epidemic caused by an unknown infectious agent, in health screening contexts performed within communities and outside of healthcare facilities or in battlefield or potential biowarfare situations, this gets more difficult. Pathogen-agnostic methods for rapid screening and triage of large numbers of people for infection status are needed, in particular methods that might work on an easily accessible biospecimen like saliva. Here, we identify a small, core set of approximately 70 human genes whose transcripts serve as saliva-based biomarkers of infection in the human body, in a way that is agnostic to the specific pathogen causing infection.",biomarkers;host gene transcripts;infectious disease screening;innate immunity;saliva;transcriptional response to infection,pandemic
Development and evaluation of the automated multipurpose molecular testing system PCRpack for high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing.,"Increasing the reliable testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is important for the diagnosis and control of COVID-19. We developed an automated, customizable, easy-to-implement molecular testing system, named PCRpack, for the high-throughput testing of SARS-CoV-2. PCRpack includes a liquid handling instrument enclosed in a negative-pressure clean booth (Biomek i5), a laboratory information management system (SimpPCR), other equipment, and documents that are needed for testing operation. An in vitro diagnostic assay was employed to detect SARS-CoV-2. System performance was evaluated based on liquid handling accuracy and precision, analytical sensitivity, clinical diagnostic performance, and testing capacity per day. Clinical diagnostic performance was determined against the reference extraction-based reverse transcription-PCR assay using 3,965 upper respiratory samples. Analytical sensitivity analysis showed a lower limit of detection of 1,000 genome copies/mL of sample. The accuracy and precision of sample or reagent dispensing in PCRpack ranged from -2.24% to 0.73% and 0.83% to 4.52%, respectively. In the evaluation of clinical samples, PCRpack showed a positive percent agreement of 96.6% and a negative percent agreement of 100% compared with the reference assay. The average turnaround times per 94 samples and the maximum numbers of tests within an 8-hour shift of one operator were 2 hours and 28 minutes vs 2 hours and 1 minute and 564 vs 376 samples for PCRpack and the manual method, respectively. The developed PCRpack system shows high liquid handling and clinical diagnostic performance and is a promising testing system for increasing the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity and testing future emerging pathogens.IMPORTANCEAccurate and fast molecular testing is important for the diagnosis and control of COVID-19. During patient surges in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratories were challenged by a higher demand for molecular testing under skilled staff shortages. We developed an automated multipurpose molecular testing system, named PCRpack, for the rapid, high-throughput testing of infectious pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. The system is provided in an all-in-one package, including a liquid handling instrument, a laboratory information management system, and other materials needed for testing operation; is highly customizable; and is easily implemented. PCRpack showed robust liquid handling performance, high clinical diagnostic performance, a shorter turn-around time with minimal hands-on time, and a high testing capacity. These features contribute to the rapid implementation of the high-performance and high-throughput molecular testing environment at any phase of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 or future emerging pathogens.",COVID-19;RT-PCR;SARS-CoV-2;automation;liquid handling instrument,pandemic
Modulation of the replication of positive-sense RNA viruses by the natural plant metabolite xanthohumol and its derivatives.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of identifying new potent antiviral agents. Nutrients as well as plant-derived substances are promising candidates because they are usually well tolerated by the human body and readily available in nature, and consequently mostly cheap to produce. A variety of antiviral effects have recently been described for the hop chalcone xanthohumol (XN), and to a lesser extent for its derivatives, making these hop compounds particularly attractive for further investigation. Noteworthy, mounting evidence indicated that XN can suppress a wide range of viruses belonging to several virus families, all of which share a common reproductive cycle. As a result, the purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent research on the antiviral properties of XN and its derivatives, with a particular emphasis on the positive-sense RNA viruses human hepatitis C virus (HCV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV-2).",HCV;Nutrition;PRRSV;SARS-CoV-2;Xanthohumol;prenylflavonoids;viral inhibition;virology,pandemic
Extended interval dosing of ocrelizumab in patients with multiple sclerosis is not associated with meaningful differences in disease activity.,"Risk concerns related to ocrelizumab treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) during the COVID-19 pandemic caused infusion delays with extended interval dosing (EID). We reviewed medical records of patients on ocrelizumab to determine whether EID maintains its effectiveness compared to standard interval dosing (SID). Among 361 patients, 231 (64%) and 123 (34%) had at least one infusion with infusion intervals of ⩾8 months and ⩾12 months, respectively. There were no differences in demographics or clinical profiles between the SID and EID groups. No significant differences between rates of breakthrough activity among relapsing-remitting patients were observed between SID (three patients) and EID (seven patients).",Multiple sclerosis;extended interval dosing;ocrelizumab;ocrevus,pandemic
Trait reactance as psychological motivation to reject vaccination: Two longitudinal studies and one experimental study.,"Anti-science attitudes can be resilient to scientific evidence if they are rooted in psychological motives. One such motive is trait reactance, which refers to the need to react with opposition when one's freedom of choice has been threatened. In three studies, we investigated trait reactance as a psychological motivation to reject vaccination. In the longitudinal studies (n = 199; 293), we examined if trait reactance measured before the COVID-19 pandemic was related to people's willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 up to 2 years later during the pandemic. In the experimental study (n = 398), we tested whether trait reactance makes anti-vaccination attitudes more resistant to information and whether this resistance can be mitigated by framing the information to minimize the risk of triggering state reactance. The longitudinal studies showed that higher trait reactance before the COVID-19 pandemic was related to lower willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Our experimental study indicated that highly reactant individuals' willingness to vaccinate was unaffected by the amount and framing of the information provided. Trait reactance has a strong and durable impact on vaccination willingness. This highlights the importance of considering the role of trait reactance in people's vaccination-related decision-making.",reactance;state reactance;trait reactance;vaccination;vaccine hesitancy,pandemic
Apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor-mediated liver damage and inflammation to cancer: Therapeutic intervention by curcumin in experimental metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis-hepatocellular carcinoma.,"In tandem with the expanding obesity pandemic, the prevalence of metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as NASH)- driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is predicted to rise globally, creating a significant need for therapeutic interventions. We previously identified the upregulation of apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor (AATF), which is implicated in facilitating the progression from MASH to HCC. The objective of this study was to examine whether the intervention of curcumin could alleviate AATF-mediated MASH, inhibit tumor growth, and elucidate the underlying mechanism. A preclinical murine model mimicking human MASH-HCC was employed, subjecting mice to either a chow diet normal water (CDNW) or western diet sugar water (WDSW) along with very low dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 - 0.2 μL/g, weekly). Mice receiving curcumin (CUR) alongside WDSW/CCl4 exhibited significant improvements, including reduced liver enzymes, dyslipidemia, steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning. Curcumin treatment also suppressed hepatic expression of inflammatory, fibrogenic, and oncogenic markers. Of note, there was a significant reduction in the expression of AATF upon curcumin treatment in WDSW/CCl4 mice and human HCC cells. In contrast, curcumin upregulated Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in MASH liver and HCC cells, which is known to downregulate sp1 (specificity protein-1) expression. Thus, curcumin treatment effectively inhibited the progression of MASH to HCC by downregulating the expression of AATF via the KLF4-Sp1 signaling pathway. These preclinical findings establish a novel molecular connection between curcumin and AATF in reducing hepatocarcinogenesis, and provide a strong rationale for the development of curcumin as a viable treatment for MASH-HCC in humans.",apoptosis antagonizing transcription factor;curcumin;hepatocellular carcinoma;inflammation;metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis;tumorigenesis,pandemic
Pregnant women's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the trimester of pregnancy.,"This study aimed to analyse the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women according to the pregnancy trimester, comparing their psychopathological symptomatology, pregnancy-specific stress, resilience and perceived stress to those of women pregnant before the pandemic. A total of 797 pregnant women participated in the study, one group of 393 women pregnant before the pandemic and the other of 404 women pregnant during the pandemic. Student-t test was used to analyse continuous data and the Chi-square test was used for categorical data. Psychopathological symptomatology was significantly higher in six subscales of the SCL-90-R in pregnant women during COVID-19: somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, obsessions-compulsions, mainly on the first two trimesters. There is also a higher level of pregnancy-specific stress in pregnant women during the pandemic on the first two trimesters, most likely due to the hypervigilance and fears related to the COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, perceived stress, usually elevated during pregnancy, was lower in women pregnant during the pandemic in comparison to those pregnant before, as a positive consequence of being on lockdown and diminishing the exposure to daily stressful situations. Knowing the struggles these women go through during each trimester of pregnancy can be the key to a better health professional-patient relationship, consequently having a positive impact on their mental and physical health.",COVID-19;Prenatal period;pregnancy trimesters;psychopathology;stress,pandemic
"Combination of aspirin and rosuvastatin for reduction of venous thromboembolism in severely injured patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic randomized phase II clinical trial (The STAT Trial).","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant source of postinjury morbidity and mortality. Beta-hydroxy beta-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (rosuvastatin) significantly reduced pathologic clotting events in healthy populations in a prior trial. Furthermore, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been shown to be noninferior to prophylactic heparinoids for VTE prevention following orthopedic surgery. We hypothesized that a combination of rosuvastatin/ASA, in addition to standard VTE chemoprophylaxis, would reduce VTE in critically ill trauma patients. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, evaluating VTE rates in two groups: ASA + statin (Experimental) and identical placebos (Control). Injured adults, 18-65 years old, admitted to the surgical intensive care unit without contraindications for VTE prophylaxis were eligible. Upon initiation of routine VTE chemoprophylaxis (i.e. heparin/heparin-derivatives), they were randomized to the Experimental or Control group. VTE was the primary outcome. Of 112 potentially eligible patients, 33% (n = 37, median new injury severity scale = 27) were successfully randomized, of whom 11% had VTEs. The Experimental group had no VTEs, while the Control group had 6 VTEs (4 PEs and 2 DVTs) in 4 (22%) patients (P = 0.046). The Experimental treatment was not associated with any serious adverse events. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was interrupted at the second interim analysis at <10% of the planned enrollment, with significance declared at P < 0.012 at that stage. The combination of ASA and rosuvastatin with standard VTE prophylaxis showed a favorable trend toward reducing VTEs with no serious adverse events. An appropriately powered phase III multicenter trial is needed to further investigate this therapeutic approach.

Analysis of the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on household solid waste management: An empirical study using PLS-SEM.,"The global increase in solid waste pollution due to economic growth and population growth has led to severe ecological deterioration. This situation is exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has significantly impacted consumer behavior and consumption habits. Proper management of solid waste has thus become critical in mitigating environmental degradation. In this study, we aim to examine the relationship between the outbreak of COVID-19, environmental attitudes (EATT), social norms (SN), environmental knowledge (EK), technological innovation (TI), and solid waste management (SWM) in Ecuadorian households during the pandemic. We collected data from 426 households in Ecuador using an online questionnaire and analyzed it using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model method to test the hypotheses. Likewise, we validated the measurement and structural model. The results are novel about SWM, considering a developing country severely affected during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 has a negative impact on SWM, while EATT, SN, and TI have a positive influence on SWM. However, we found that EK does not significantly affect SWM.",D006801:Humans;D062611:Solid Waste;D000086382:COVID-19;D018505:Waste Management;D011795:Surveys and Questionnaires;D058873:Pandemics,pandemic
"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women attending public antenatal clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.","The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed over six million lives and caused significant morbidities globally. The development and use of COVID-19 vaccines is a key strategy in ending this. There is a general public hesitancy on vaccine uptake, including pregnant women who are at high risk of severe forms of the disease and death when infected with the virus. To determine the magnitude of hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines and the associated factors among pregnant women attending public antenatal clinics in Dar es Salaam‬. This was a cross-sectional analytical study conducted among 896 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at public health facilities in Dar es Salaam. A structured interviewer-based questionnaire, in an electronic form, was used. The analysis was done by a multivariable linear regression model using STATA 16 to obtain factors associated with vaccine hesitancy, and P < .05 was considered significant. The proportion of pregnant women with vaccine hesitancy was 45%. Hesitancy was higher among unemployed pregnant women (AOR 2.16 (95% CI 1.36-3.42) and the self-employed group (AOR 1.62 (95% CI 1.07-2.44). It was also higher among pregnant women with poor attitudes to COVID-19 vaccines (AOR 2.44 (95% CI 1.75-3.39) and women who had low perceived benefits of the vaccines (AOR 2.57 (95% CI 1.83-3.60).

"""Direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on operational conduct of pediatric vaccine clinical trials"".","The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the resulting public health measures, impacted many aspects of society. The conduct of important pediatric vaccine trials was among these. Analyzing data from six ongoing non-COVID-19 pediatric vaccine trials we aimed to assess the operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using descriptive analyses. We identified multiple operational disruptions in trial conduct. Additionally, we identified higher percentages of missed routine vaccinations than investigational vaccines throughout the observation period. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was most apparent early in the pandemic period while adaptations to the pandemic were developed; however, some disruptions persisted throughout the observation period. Pediatric vaccine clinical trials are critical to developing new and/or improved vaccines for the pediatric population.

Formative assessments during COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study on performance and experiences of medical students.,"Background: Because of COVID-19, the 2020 written medical examinations were replaced by mandatory formative online assessments. This study aimed to determine students' performance, self-assessment of performance, and perception about the switch from a summative to a formative approach. Methods: Medical students from year 2 to 5 (n=648) were included. They could repeat each test once or twice. They rated their performance after each attempt and were then given their score. Detailed feedback was given at the end of the session. An online survey determined medical students' perception about the reorganization of education. Two items concerned the switch from summative to formative assessments Results: Formative assessments involved 2385 examinees totaling 3197 attempts. Among examinees, 30.8% made at least 2 attempts. Scores increased significantly at the second attempt (median 9.4, IQR 10.8), and duration decreased (median -31.0, IQR 48.0). More than half of examinees (54.6%) underestimated their score, female students more often than male. Low performers overestimated, while high performers underestimated their scores. Students approved of the switch to formative assessments. Stress was lessened but motivation for learning decreased. Conclusions: Medical students' better scores at a second attempt support a benefit of detailed feedback, learning time and re-test opportunity on performance. Decreased learning motivation and a minority of students repeating the formative assessments point to the positive influence of summative assessment on learning.",COVID-19;assessment;distance education;medical education,pandemic
"Cell type dependent stability and virulence of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2, and engineering of a propagation deficient RNA replicon to analyze virus RNA synthesis.","Engineering of reverse genetics systems for newly emerged viruses allows viral genome manipulation, being an essential tool for the study of virus life cycle, virus-host interactions and pathogenesis, as well as for the development of effective antiviral strategies. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent human coronavirus that has caused the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The engineering of a full-length infectious cDNA clone and a fluorescent replicon of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1, using a bacterial artificial chromosome, is reported. Viral growth and genetic stability in eleven cell lines were analyzed, showing that both VeroE6 cells overexpressing transmembrane serin protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and human lung derived cells resulted in the optimization of a cell system to preserve SARS-CoV-2 genetic stability. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 virus and a point mutant expressing the D614G spike protein variant were virulent in a mouse model. The RNA replicon was propagation-defective, allowing its use in BSL-2 conditions to analyze viral RNA synthesis. The SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics systems developed constitute a useful tool for studying the molecular biology of the virus, the development of genetically defined vaccines and to establish systems for antiviral compounds screening.","D051379:Mice;D000818:Animals;D006801:Humans;D000086402:SARS-CoV-2;D000086382:COVID-19;D014774:Virulence;D012367:RNA, Viral;D000998:Antiviral Agents;D012093:Replicon;D014779:Virus Replication",pandemic
Enhancing Employee Job Satisfaction Responding to COVID-19: The Role of Organizational Adaptive Practices and Psychological Resilience.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected all aspects of people's lives and work, negatively impacting personal well-being and job satisfaction. Based on the conservation of resources theory, this study examines the relationship of organizational adaptive practices (OAP) responding to COVID-19 and psychological resilience (PR) with employee job satisfaction (JS) while incorporating the mediating role of emotional exhaustion (EE). We surveyed 340 employees from China through an online questionnaire, which was used under convenience sampling and finally recovered a valid sample size of 314. We used SPSS and AMOS to analyze the correlation and hypothesis testing of the collected data through structural equation modelling (SEM) and bootstrapping. Both OAP and PR facilitate JS and inhibit employee EE. EE negatively predicted employee JS. EE mediated both the relationship between OAP and subordinate JS and the relationship between PR and subordinate JS. The study provides a new perspective on increasing JS during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby expanding the scope of the antecedents of employee JS in crisis situations. It also reveals the mediating role of EE and deepens the research on the mechanism by which OAP and PR affect individuals, providing practical guidance for organizations to improve employee satisfaction in sudden public crisis situations.",COVID-19;emotional exhaustion;job satisfaction;organizational adaptive practices;psychological resilience,pandemic
Penthrox,"Methoxyflurane has excellent analgesic properties and is approved for use in the United Kingdom and Ireland since 2015. It is currently used in emergency departments for analgesia during fracture reductions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, with theatre access severely restricted, Penthrox® had the potential to provide adequate pain relief to aid frame and wire removal in the clinic setting. Patients presenting to the limb reconstruction service elective clinic and requiring frame removal or minor procedures were included in the study. Patients with renal, cardiac or hepatic disease, a history of sensitivity to fluorinated anaesthetic agents and those on any nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs were excluded. All procedures were performed in an appropriate isolated room in the clinic. Patient demographics, procedure details, visual analogue score, Richmond Agitation Scale and patient satisfaction were recorded. A total of 39 patients were included in the study of which 17 had Ilizarov frames removed, 10 had hexapod removals, nine had heel rings removed and three had an external fixator removed. Eleven patients received additional pain relief in the form of oral analgesia. All patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the experience. One patient required a general anaesthetic for the removal of a wire that could not be removed in the clinic due to bony overgrowth. Patient satisfaction was very high (>95%), and it was possible to perform frame removals and minor procedures in the clinic environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We see potential for regular use of Penthrox® in the future for the removal of external fixation outside of the operating theatre. Penthrox as an analgesic for frame adjustments and removals is safe and has the potential for significant financial savings for the National Health Service (NHS).

The antimicrobial peptide Esc(1-21)-1c increases susceptibility of ,"Introduction: The increase in bacterial strains resistant to conventional antibiotics is an alarming problem for human health and could lead to pandemics in the future. Among bacterial pathogens responsible for a large variety of severe infections there is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new molecules with antimicrobial activity or that can act as adjuvants of antibiotics already in use. In this scenario, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold great promise. Recently, we characterized a frog-skin AMP derived from esculentin-1a, namely Esc(1-21)-1c, endowed with antipseudomonal activity without being cytotoxic to human cells. Methods: The combinatorial effect of the peptide and antibiotics was investigated through the checkerboard assay, differential proteomic and transcriptional analysis. Results: Here, we found that Esc(1-21)-1c can synergistically inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa cells with three different antibiotics, including tetracycline. We therefore investigated the underlying mechanism implemented by the peptide using a differential proteomic approach. The data revealed a significant decrease in the production of three proteins belonging to the MexAB-OprM efflux pump upon treatment with sub-inhibitory concentration of Esc(1-21)-1c. Down-regulation of these proteins was confirmed by transcriptional analysis and direct measurement of their relative levels in bacterial cells by tandem mass spectrometry analysis in multiple reaction monitoring scan mode. Conclusion: These evidences suggest that treatment with Esc(1-21)-1c in combination with antibiotics would increase the intracellular drug content making bacteria more susceptible to the antibiotic. Overall, these results highlight the importance of characterizing new molecules able to synergize with conventional antibiotics, paving the way for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies based on AMP/antibiotic formulations to counteract the emergence of resistant bacterial strains and increase the use of ""old"" antibiotics in medical practice.",Pseudomonas aeruginosa;antibiotics;antimicrobial peptide;efflux pumps;proteomic;tetracycline,pandemic
The epidemiology of ,"Aedes-borne arboviral diseases were important public health problems in Zhejiang before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study was conducted to investigate the characteristics and change of the epidemiology of Aedes-borne arboviral diseases in the province. Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize the epidemiology of Aedes-borne arboviral diseases during 2003-2022. A total of 3,125 cases, including 1,968 indigenous cases, were reported during 2003-2022. Approximately three-quarters of imported cases were infected from Southeast Asia. The number of annual imported cases increased during 2013-2019 (R2 = 0.801, p = 0.004) and peaked in 2019. When compared with 2003-2012, all prefecture-level cities witnessed an increase in the annual mean incidence of imported cases in 2013-2019 (0.11-0.42 per 100,000 population vs. 0-0.05 per 100,000 population) but a drastic decrease during 2020-2022 (0-0.03 per 100,000 population). The change in geographical distribution was similar, with 33/91 counties during 2003-2012, 86/91 during 2013-2019, and 14/91 during 2020-2022. The annual mean incidence of indigenous cases in 2013-2019 was 7.79 times that in 2003-2012 (0.44 vs. 0.06 per 100,000 population). No indigenous cases were reported between 2020-2022. Geographical extension of indigenous cases was also noted before 2020-from two counties during 2003-2012 to 44 during 2013-2019.

"COVID-19 pandemic-related weight gain in the pediatric population declined after restrictions ended, except among obese patients.","Childhood obesity has become an important topic, not only of increasing relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic but specifically enhanced by it. Restrictions implemented to mitigate further outbreaks led to major constraints on daily physical activity, leading to a severe increase in body weight among children. This study highlights changes in BMI and weight development in children during and (in particular) after the COVID-19 restrictions in Austria, focusing on various socioeconomic factors. Weight development throughout the pandemic and socioeconomic factors were evaluated by anonymous cross-sectional surveys filled out by parents at a pediatric practice. This study included 388 children. The rate of obesity increased by 88.5%, from 6.4 to 12.1%, throughout the pandemic, reaching a maximum of 15.2% during the restrictions. Overall, age-adapted BMI z-scores increased significantly by 0.22 during the restrictions and remained increased by 0.19 compared to pre-pandemic levels. With the exception of obese children, all children in the study population experienced significant weight loss after the restrictions were lifted. Obese children continued to gain weight without any sign of the onset of normalization. Socioeconomic factors, such as participation in regular activity in the form of organized sport or the availability of an outdoor area, were associated with relevant differences before the pandemic but had no protective effect against intra-pandemic weight gain. A higher level of parental education was the only factor associated with less weight gain in children during the early phase of the pandemic. Austrian COVID-19 restrictions have had concerning effects on pediatric BMI, with very little effect of socioeconomic background. After restrictions were loosened, measurable weight loss occurred, but the significant increase in children's BMI percentiles persisted. No weight loss was observed among children who were obese prior to the pandemic. There is a need for broad projects tackling childhood obesity, as obese children are the most vulnerable group with the strongest and most severe long-term effects.",D006801:Humans;D002648:Child;D063766:Pediatric Obesity;D058873:Pandemics;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D000086382:COVID-19;D015430:Weight Gain;D015431:Weight Loss,pandemic
Molecular Diagnosis of COVID-19; Biosafety and Pre-analytical Recommendations.,"From the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, clinical laboratories around the world have been involved with tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2. At present, RT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay) is seen as the gold standard for identifying the virus. Many factors are involved in achieving the highest accuracy in this test, including parameters related to the pre-analysis stage. Having instructions on the type of sample, how to take the sample, and its storage and transportation help control the interfering factors at this stage. Studies have shown that pre-analytical factors might be the cause of the high SARS-CoV-2 test false-negative rates. Also, the safety of personnel in molecular laboratories is of utmost importance, and it requires strict guidelines to ensure the safety of exposed individuals and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the onset of the outbreak, various instructions and guidelines have been developed in this field by the institutions and the Ministry of Health of each country; these guidelines are seriously in need of integration and operation. In this study, we try to collect all the information and research done from the beginning of this pandemic in December 2019 - August 2022 concerning biosafety and protective measures, sample types, sampling methods, container, and storage solutions, sampling equipment, and sample storage and transportation for molecular testing of SARS-CoV-2.",COVID-19;bio-safety;diagnosis;pre-analytical;sampling;transportation,pandemic
"Comparative Analysis of 198 SARS-CoV-2 Genomes from Iran and West Asia, February 2020 to December 2021.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in a worldwide pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 was reported from Wuhan in the Hubei Province of China in December 2019; however, the disease's origin is still mysterious. Whole-genome sequence analysis is essential for monitoring the spread of infectious diseases as well as studying the pathogenesis and evolution of viruses. In this study, analysis of 198 fully sequenced genomes from Iran and West Asia was carried out to study mutations, phylogeny, amino acid changes, clades, and lineages of these genomes as well as comparison of these sequences with those of reference Wuhan genome of NC_045512.2. In total, 198 completely sequenced genome data from Iran and West Asia were collected from GenBank. Mutation detection was carried out using a trial version of CLC Genomics Workbench v.21.0 (QIAGEN, Germany). Online tools such as GISAID Mutations App and Pangolin were used for further analysis of the results. In this study, several unique mutation sites were identified in the Iranian genomes (n = 8); positions 1397 G>A and 29742 G>T were the most frequent changes in more than 85% of the Iranian genomes. Mutation rate, mutation per sequence, and transition versus transversion for the Iranian genomes included 4.73, 14.14, and 1.6, respectively. Generally, C>T alteration was the most common substitution in all the sequences. The ORF1ab, N, and S were the genes with the most changes.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy following a virtual work meeting during COVID-19 pandemic: a case report.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a great impact on both, physical and psychological wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic promoted increasing digitalization of the work environment and social isolation. This psychosocial stress in turn can induce physical distress with clinical manifestation. So can the changed work and social environment in the COVID-19 pandemic trigger acute cardiovascular disease? Here, we present a case of a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman suffering from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) evoked by emotional stress during a virtual work meeting. Like many others, our patient was urged to work from home (WFH) in accordance with the contact restrictions due to COVID-19. She presented at our chest pain unit with typical angina pectoris-like symptoms such as chest pain and dyspnea. Laboratory analysis confirmed increased troponin levels and evolving T wave inversion in electrocardiogram. Acute coronary syndrome management was commenced. Coronary angiography and left ventriculography revealed non-obstructive coronary arteries and apical ballooning syndrome. Due to immediate guideline-directed treatment with bisoprolol, ramipril, spironolactone and acetylsalicylic acid the patient's condition improved so that she could be discharged after seven days. During a 3-month follow-up the patient showed a normalized ejection fraction and reported no discomfort anymore. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also elucidated the importance of the psychosocial health issues in acute cardiovascular care. Having in mind that the social and work environment recently has changed immensely, thus enforcing social isolation and emotional distress, doctors as well as patients must consider TTC as possible etiology of sudden chest pain.",Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC);case report;coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19);left ventricular systolic dysfunction;work from home (WFH),pandemic
Surgical therapy for major lung parenchymal damage from late coronavirus disease complication: case report and literature review.,"Coronavirus disease [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 19 (SARS COVID-19)] has emerged as one of the most challenging diseases of recent decades. After the pandemic outbreak, our knowledge of the virus has expanded and developed, but we face a new wave of atypical complications that require special attention. In addition to the acute complications of COVID-19 infection, late complications of the disease are taking an increasingly important part in the management of affected patients, which are grouped under the collective term ""Long COVID"". In this work, we present our therapy strategy in three cases of pulmonary cavity as a late complication after COVID-19, as well as perform a literature review of published articles in this matter. This study includes 3 cases of pulmonary cavities as a late COVID complication. Among them only one patient was vaccinated. The mean duration between the occurrence of Long COVID and SARS COVID-19 disease was 4 weeks in our patients. All patients underwent adequate medical therapy after Long COVID. However, due to the disease progression and significant elevated infections parameters, all patients underwent surgical therapy. One patient underwent uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and decortication of the empyema, whereas we performed thoracotomy for other patients. All patients treated successfully and discharged shortly after the operation. Our literature review provides a total of 12 publications with only 50 patients. No patients received vaccination. The mean interval time between acute infection and the appearance of pulmonary cavities was about 4 weeks. The results showed that most patients were treated with conservative therapies. Only two patients were treated using invasive therapies. Both patients were successfully treated and recovered from the procedures. This group of late complications COVID patients requires individualized treatment strategy.

A Delphi consensus on the management of anticoagulation in the COVID-19 pandemic: the MONACO study.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, guideline documents on the management of anticoagulation were rapidly published. However, these documents did not follow a structured methodology, and significant differences existed between the guidelines. The aim of this expert consensus was to provide recommendations on the clinical management of oral anticoagulation in patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A two-round Delphi study was conducted using an online survey. In the first round, panellists expressed their level of agreement with the items on a 9-point Likert scale. Items were selected if they received approval from ≥66.6% of panellists and if they were agreed by the scientific committee. In the second round, panellists revaluated those items that did not meet consensus in the first round. A total of 147 panellists completed the first round, and 144 of them completed the second round. Consensus was reached on 161 items included in five dimensions. These dimensions addressed: (I) management of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) without mechanical valves or moderate/severe mitral stenosis during COVID-19 infection; (II) thromboprophylaxis in patients hospitalised for COVID-19; (III) management of anticoagulation at hospital discharge/after COVID-19; (IV) anticoagulation monitoring in the COVID-19 pandemic setting; and (V) role of telemedicine in the management and follow-up of patients with AF in the COVID-19 pandemic setting.

Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Severity of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Admissions and New Diagnoses.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges to the diagnosis and management of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many patients have had only limited access to their providers through telemedicine, and many chose to delay nonemergent treatment. A retrospective chart review of patients with IBD seen by the Pediatric Gastroenterology Division at Doernbecher Children's Hospital from January 2018 to August 2021 was conducted. The study cohort was divided into 2 groups: those presenting before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (January 1, 2018 to February 28, 2020) and those presenting during the pandemic (March 1, 2020 to August 1, 2021). Variables collected included: age, sex, race, ethnicity, IBD type, insurance type, location of residence. Primary outcome measures selected focused on disease severity, initial type of treatment, or surgical intervention offered. A subgroup analysis of the new diagnosis patients was performed. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests, chi-squared analysis, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Two hundred and eleven patients met inclusion criteria, 107 (72 new diagnoses, 35 admissions) within the pre-COVID epoch and 104 (67 new diagnoses, 37 admissions) within the during-COVID epoch. Patients in the during-COVID epoch had higher fecal calprotectin level and were more likely to be started on a biologic as initial treatment. Patients admitted during COVID for IBD flare were more likely to require surgical intervention. Subgroup analysis of newly diagnosed patients revealed higher incidence of comorbid depression and anxiety. Our review identified increased disease severity in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with IBD as well as pediatric patients admitted for flare during COVID. Increases in anxiety and depression rates during COVID may have contributed to worsened disease severity.",COVID-19;VEO-IBD;disease severity;pediatric IBD;telehealth,pandemic
Psychological support during a pandemic: an intervention for hospital teams.,"The COVID-19 pandemic placed unprecedented stress on healthcare professionals and resulted in teams being scattered by shielding, working from home and redeployment. The Recovery, Readjustment and Reintegration programme (R3P) was implemented and evaluated in an acute NHS hospital Trust with the aim of supporting those staff involved. To explore the impact of offering themed reflective sessions to staff in an acute hospital and to disseminate this learning for application in other settings and future pandemics. During the initial recovery phase of the pandemic, all Trust staff were invited to attend an R3P where themed discussions were facilitated by psychologists. Feedback was requested pre- and post-session, and a mixed-methods design was followed to gain quantitative and qualitative information. A total of 430 staff members attended an R3P between April 2021 and January 2022. A significant majority found attendance helpful and agreed that it had provided them with the opportunity to reflect on their own and their teams' experience of pandemic working and led them to feel more supported by their organization. Finding meaning in experiences through facilitated reflective discussion can help limit the negative psychological impact of working in an acute hospital during a pandemic. Staff are likely to benefit from such opportunities in any future pandemic recovery phase.",,pandemic
Barriers to healthcare-worker adherence to infection prevention and control practices in British Columbia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: A cross-sectional study.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of robust infection prevention and control (IPAC) practices to maintain patient and staff safety. However, healthcare workers (HCWs) face many barriers that affect their ability to follow these practices. We identified barriers affecting HCW adherence to IPAC practices during the pandemic in British Columbia, Canada. Cross-sectional web-based survey. Acute care, long-term care or assisted living, outpatient, mental health, prehospital care, and home care. Eligible respondents included direct-care providers and IPAC professionals working in these settings in all health authorities across British Columbia. We conducted a web-based survey from August to September 2021 to assess respondent knowledge and attitudes toward IPAC within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which various barriers affected their ability to follow IPAC practices throughout the pandemic and to make suggestions for improvement. The final analysis included 2,488 responses; 36% of respondents worked in acute care. Overall, perceptions of IPAC practice among non-IPAC professionals were positive. The main self-perceived barriers to adherence included inadequate staffing to cover absences (58%), limited space in staff rooms (57%), multibed rooms (51%), and confusing messages about IPAC practices (51%). Common suggestions for improvement included receiving more support from IPAC leadership and clearer communication about required IPAC practices. Our findings highlight frontline HCW perspectives regarding priority areas of improvement for IPAC practices. They will inform policy and guideline development to prevent transmission of COVID-19 and future emerging infections.",,pandemic
Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19-Related Stressor Exposure and Adverse Mental Health Outcomes Among Health Care Workers.,"Racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to COVID-19-related stressors, pandemic-related distress, and adverse mental health outcomes were assessed among health care workers in the Bronx, New York, during the first wave of the pandemic. The authors analyzed survey data from 992 health care workers using adjusted logistic regression models to assess differential prevalence of outcomes by race/ethnicity and their interactions. Compared with their White colleagues, Latinx, Black, Asian, and multiracial/other health care workers reported significantly higher exposure to multiple COVID-19-related stressors: redeployment, fear of being sick, lack of autonomy at work, and inadequate access to personal protective equipment. Endorsing a greater number of COVID-19-related stressors was associated with pandemic-related distress in all groups and with adverse mental health outcomes in some groups; it was not related to hazardous alcohol use in any of the groups. These associations were not significantly different between racial and ethnic groups. Latinx health care workers had significantly higher probabilities of pandemic-related distress and posttraumatic stress than White colleagues. Despite greater exposure to COVID-19-related stressors, Black, Asian, and multiracial/other health care workers had the same, if not lower, prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes. Conversely, White health care workers had a higher adjusted prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety compared with Asian colleagues and greater hazardous alcohol use compared with all other groups. Health care workers from racial and ethnic minority groups reported increased exposure to COVID-19-related stressors, suggestive of structural racism in the health care workforce. These results underscore the need for increased support for health care workers and interventions aimed at mitigating disparities in vocational exposure to risk and stress.",Anxiety Disorders;Coronavirus/COVID-19;Depressive Disorders;Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD);Sociopolitical Issues;Structural Racism,pandemic
Public Health Response Measures for COVID-19 in Kazakhstan.,"The article describes measures developed to counter the spread of coronavirus infection in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kazakhstan were detected on March 13, 2020, among people who arrived from Germany. After declaring the state of emergency in the country, the Ministry of Healthcare of the Republic of Kazakhstan began to formulate and implement a comprehensive package of measures aimed at slowing down and stopping the transmission of infection, preventing outbreaks, ensuring optimal care for all patients, especially the seriously ill, minimizing the negative impact of the pandemic on health systems, social services, and economic activities. Developed set of restrictive measures was approved by the Country Office of Word Health Organization (WHO) in Kazakhstan, being later adapted by the European Union (EU) countries and applied in Kyrgyzstan. In addition, article identifies Kazakhstan's experience in creating epidemiological surveillance systems, studying virus mutations, and the clinical aspects of dealing with it to combat the infection. It also indicates the impact of the epidemic on health-care workers and the development of measures to protect them, strengthening infection prevention, and control in medical organizations.",D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D011634:Public Health;D007623:Kazakhstan;D003695:Delivery of Health Care;D058873:Pandemics,pandemic
Have mRNA vaccines sentenced DNA vaccines to death?,"After receiving emergency approval during the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines have taken center stage in the quest to enhance future vaccination strategies for both infectious diseases and cancer. Indeed, they have significantly overshadowed another facet of genetic vaccination, specifically DNA vaccines. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that both types of genetic vaccines have distinct advantages and disadvantages that set them apart from each other. In this work, we delve extensively into the history of genetic vaccines, their mechanisms of action, their strengths, and limitations, and ultimately highlight ongoing research in key areas for potential enhancement of both DNA and mRNA vaccines. Here, we assess the significance of the primary benefits and drawbacks associated with DNA and mRNA vaccination. We challenge the current lines of thought by highlighting that the existing drawbacks of DNA vaccination could potentially be more straightforward to address compared to those linked with mRNA vaccination. In our view, this suggests that DNA vaccines should remain viable contenders in the pursuit of the future of vaccination.",DNA vaccine;T-cell response;adjuvants;antibody response;cytokine response;encapsulation;formulation;innate response;mRNA vaccine;protein translation,pandemic

Effectiveness of the holistic primary school-based intervention MindMatters: study protocol for a cluster-randomised controlled trial.,"The prevalence of mental health problems in childhood and adolescence has increased significantly, not least due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and other countries worldwide. Although holistic school interventions to promote mental health and prevent mental health problems are considered promising, there is currently uncertainty about their effectiveness due to evaluation studies with heterogeneous methodological quality. This paper presents the study protocol for the evaluation of the primary school module of MindMatters. As part of a universal mental health intervention, the MindMatters primary school module 'Learning Together with Emotions' aims to promote social-emotional learning (SEL) in the classroom across five skill areas. In addition to classroom activities, the intervention includes a school development module to help primary schools create structures and processes to maintain and promote mental health. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, a two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted, including schools implementing MindMatters over a 12-month period and a control group with no access to the intervention. Data will be collected before and 18 months after initiation of the intervention. Controlled for baseline conditions, multilevel regression analysis will be used to examine primary intervention outcomes at the pupil level (i.e. reductions in mental and behavioural problems). Further mediation and moderation analyses will examine whether proximal outcomes predict changes in mental health outcomes and whether school-level factors influence the effectiveness of the intervention. This study will contribute to strengthen the evidence base for holistic school (mental) health promotion interventions using a study design with high internal validity. Based on an intervention model, the results will not only provide insights into the relationship between proximal and distal outcomes, but will also allow conclusions to be drawn about how the implementation of the intervention affects its effectiveness. Finally, the findings also address the question of whether improved mental health has a positive effect on primary school pupils' academic performance. German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00023762.

Characterization of intrinsic and effective fitness changes caused by temporarily fixed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike E484 epitope and identification of an epistatic precondition for the evolution of E484A in variant Omicron.,"Intrinsic fitness costs are likely to have guided the selection of lineage-determining mutations during emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2. Whereas changes in receptor affinity and antibody neutralization have been thoroughly mapped for individual mutations in spike, their influence on intrinsic replicative fitness remains understudied. We analyzed mutations in immunodominant spike epitope E484 that became temporarily fixed over the pandemic. We engineered the resulting immune escape mutations E484K, -A, and -Q in recombinant SARS-CoV-2. We characterized viral replication, entry, and competitive fitness with and without immune serum from humans with defined exposure/vaccination history and hamsters monospecifically infected with the E484K variant. We additionally engineered a virus containing the Omicron signature mutations N501Y and Q498R that were predicted to epistatically enhance receptor binding. Multistep growth kinetics in Vero-, Calu-3, and NCI-H1299 were identical between viruses. Synchronized entry experiments based on cold absorption and temperature shift identified only an insignificant trend toward faster entry of the E484K variant. Competitive passage experiments revealed clear replicative fitness differences. In absence of immune serum, E484A and E484Q, but not E484K, were replaced by wildtype (WT) in competition assays. In presence of immune serum, all three mutants outcompeted WT. Decreased E484A fitness levels were over-compensated for by N501Y and Q498R, identifying a putative Omicron founder background that exceeds the intrinsic and effective fitness of WT and matches that of E484K. Critically, the E484A/Q498R/N501Y mutant and E484K have equal fitness also in presence of pre-Omicron vaccinee serum, whereas the fitness gain by E484K is lost in the presence of serum raised against the E484K variant in hamsters. The emergence of E484A and E484Q prior to widespread population immunity may have been limited by fitness costs. In populations already exposed to the early immune escape epitope E484K, the Omicron founder background may have provided a basis for alternative immune escape evolution via E484A. Studies of major antigenic epitope changes with and without their epistatic context help reconstruct the sequential adjustments of intrinsic fitness versus neutralization escape during the evolution of major SARS-CoV-2 variants in an increasingly immune human population.","D000818:Animals;D006224:Cricetinae;D006801:Humans;D000939:Epitopes;D000086402:SARS-CoV-2;D000086382:COVID-19;D009154:Mutation;D007106:Immune Sera;D016056:Immunodominant Epitopes;D064370:Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus;D057134:Antibodies, Neutralizing",pandemic
Impact of vaccination against severe COVID-19 in the French population aged 50 years and above: a retrospective population-based study.,"Given the widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccination to mitigate the pandemic from the end of 2020, it is important to retrospectively evaluate its impact, in particular by quantifying the number of severe outcomes prevented through vaccination. We estimated the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths directly averted by vaccination in France, in people aged ≥ 50 years, from December 2020 to March 2022, based on (1) the number of observed events, (2) vaccination coverage, and (3) vaccine effectiveness. We accounted for the effect of primary vaccination and the first booster dose, the circulating variants, the age groups, and the waning of vaccine-induced protection over time. An estimated 480,150 (95% CI: 260,072-582,516) hospitalizations, 132,156 (50,409-157,767) ICU admissions and 125,376 (53,792-152,037) deaths were directly averted by vaccination in people aged ≥ 50 years, which corresponds to a reduction of 63.2% (48.2-67.6), 68.7% (45.6-72.4) and 62.7% (41.9-67.1) respectively, compared to what would have been expected without vaccination over the study period. An estimated 5852 (2285-6853) deaths were directly averted among the 50-59 years old, 16,837 (6568-19,473) among the 60-69 years old, 32,136 (13,651-36,758) among the 70-79 years old and 70,551 (31,288-88,953) among the ≥ 80 years old.

Policies to prevent zoonotic spillover: a systematic scoping review of evaluative evidence.,"Emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin present a critical threat to global population health. As accelerating globalisation makes epidemics and pandemics more difficult to contain, there is a need for effective preventive interventions that reduce the risk of zoonotic spillover events. Public policies can play a key role in preventing spillover events. The aim of this review is to identify and describe evaluations of public policies that target the determinants of zoonotic spillover. Our approach is informed by a One Health perspective, acknowledging the inter-connectedness of human, animal and environmental health. In this systematic scoping review, we searched Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Global Health in May 2021 using search terms combining animal health and the animal-human interface, public policy, prevention and zoonoses. We screened titles and abstracts, extracted data and reported our process in line with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We also searched relevant organisations' websites for evaluations published in the grey literature. All evaluations of public policies aiming to prevent zoonotic spillover events were eligible for inclusion. We summarised key data from each study, mapping policies along the spillover pathway. Our review found 95 publications evaluating 111 policies. We identified 27 unique policy options including habitat protection; trade regulations; border control and quarantine procedures; farm and market biosecurity measures; public information campaigns; and vaccination programmes, as well as multi-component programmes. These were implemented by many sectors, highlighting the cross-sectoral nature of zoonotic spillover prevention. Reports emphasised the importance of surveillance data in both guiding prevention efforts and enabling policy evaluation, as well as the importance of industry and private sector actors in implementing many of these policies. Thoughtful engagement with stakeholders ranging from subsistence hunters and farmers to industrial animal agriculture operations is key for policy success in this area. This review outlines the state of the evaluative evidence around policies to prevent zoonotic spillover in order to guide policy decision-making and focus research efforts. Since we found that most of the existing policy evaluations target 'downstream' determinants, additional research could focus on evaluating policies targeting 'upstream' determinants of zoonotic spillover, such as land use change, and policies impacting infection intensity and pathogen shedding in animal populations, such as those targeting animal welfare.","D000818:Animals;D006801:Humans;D015047:Zoonoses;D021821:Communicable Diseases, Emerging;D014943:Global Health;D011050:Policy Making;D057766:Policy",pandemic
Intrusive rumination and academic burnout among adolescents in ethnic minority areas of China during the COVID-19 pandemic: PTSS as mediator and cognitive reappraisal as moderator.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on public health, prompting scholarly research in related fields. In this context, the present study reveals the psychological characteristics of adolescents in ethnic minority areas of China approximately five months after the 2020 outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, explores the relationship between intrusive rumination and academic burnout, and examines the role of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and cognitive reappraisal in the relationship to provide an empirical foundation for developing effective psychological interventions for adolescents in the wake of the pandemic. Based on cluster sampling, 941 middle school students (65.36% female, 74.71% senior high, Mage=15.95) in ethnic minority areas of China were surveyed using the Event Related Rumination Scale, Adolescent Academic Burnout Scale, Post-traumatic Stress Checklist Scale, Emotion Regulation Strategy Scale, and a self-designed demographic questionnaire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 7.44% of Chinese ethnic minority adolescents in our study sample were classified as PTSD positive, and 10.95% exhibited partial PTSD. Intrusive rumination significantly predicted academic burnout, and PTSS played a key mediating role between the two, accounting for 58.51% of the total effect. After controlling for PTSS, cognitive reappraisal moderated the effects of intrusive rumination on academic burnout. Specifically, the effect of intrusive rumination on academic burnout decreased with improvement in cognitive reappraisal. Intrusive rumination indirectly affected academic burnout in adolescents through PTSS as a crucial mediator, and the remnant direct effect was alleviated by cognitive reappraisal. This finding emphasises the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach that encompasses cognitive, emotional, and physiological symptoms to understand and address academic burnout among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","D006801:Humans;D000293:Adolescent;D005260:Female;D008297:Male;D013313:Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;D058873:Pandemics;D000091762:Ethnic and Racial Minorities;D005006:Ethnicity;D008913:Minority Groups;D000086382:COVID-19;D000077062:Burnout, Psychological;D002055:Burnout, Professional;D003071:Cognition",pandemic
Pediatric Obesity Care via Telemedicine: Expanding the Path Forward-A Review.,"Review latest data regarding the intersection of pediatric obesity epidemic with telemedicine expansion to meet the need of equitable obesity care in children. Prevalence of pediatric obesity in the USA continues to worsen particularly in rural, underserved areas. Although there is an increasing number of obesity medicine specialists over the last decade, availability varies by geographic location. Pre-pandemic centers were limited, rarely located in rural areas, and required in-person visits for reimbursement. Telemedicine changes, responding to pandemic needs, provided increase in telemedicine utilization and acceptance with similar or improved obesity care outcomes. Given pediatric obesity prevalence and need for chronic, effective obesity care, leveraging telemedicine to expand reach and decrease access barriers provides a critical and creative remedy. Data cites similar outcomes between telemedicine and in-person care.

"COVID-19-Related Risk, Resilience, and Mental Health Among Mexican American Mothers Across the First Year of the Pandemic.","Latina mothers have been especially affected by the pandemic and historically exhibit high rates of depression and anxiety. However, few longitudinal studies have assessed the effect of the pandemic on this vulnerable population. We hypothesized that COVID-19-related stressors would associate with psychological distress among Latina mothers across the first year of the pandemic. We investigated COVID-19-related impact, stigma, and fears across two critical time points and changes in these measures in relation to changes in maternal anxiety and depression among mothers of Mexican descent living in Southern California (n=152). Surveys were administered within 5-16 weeks of the March 19, 2020 stay-at-home COVID-19 order in California and again between June to December 2021. High proportions of women reported moderate to severe impacts of COVID-19 early in the pandemic, which reduced modestly a year later, e.g., reduced family incomes (55.9% 2020 Lockdown vs 32.7% 1-year follow-up). Anticipatory stigma was high across the first year, e.g., worrying at least some of the time that a family member will be deported (33.1% 2020 Lockdown vs. 14.1% 1-year follow-up), or they would not be able to care for their children (88.5% 2020 lockdown vs 82.2% 1-year follow-up). COVID-19 stigma, impact, and fears were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms at both time points (p<0.003), and changes in COVID-19 impact were associated with changes in depression (p=0.0004). Findings emphasize the adverse socioeconomic and psychological effects of the pandemic for Latina mothers.",Anxiety;COVID-19;Depression;Latina;Stigma,pandemic

Factors Informing High-Risk Primary Care Patient Choice around Telehealth Use: a Framework.,"While telehealth's presence in post-pandemic primary care appears assured, its exact role remains unknown. Value-based care's expansion has heightened interest in telehealth's potential to improve uptake of preventive and chronic disease care, especially among high-risk primary care populations. Despite this, the pandemic underscored patients' diverse preferences around using telehealth. Understanding the factors underlying this population's preferences can inform future telehealth strategies. To describe the factors informing high-risk primary care patient choice of whether to pursue primary care via telehealth, in-office or to defer care altogether. Qualitative, cross-sectional study utilizing semi-structured telephone interviews of a convenience sample of 29 primary care patients between July 13 and September 30, 2020. Primary care patients at high risk of poor health outcomes and/or acute care utilization who were offered a follow-up primary care visit via audiovisual, audio-only or in-office modalities. Responses were analyzed via grounded theory, using a constant comparison method to refine emerging categories, distinguish codes, and synthesize evolving themes. Of the 29 participants, 16 (55.2%) were female and 19 (65.5%) were Black; the mean age (SD) was 64.6 (11.1). Participants identified four themes influencing their choice of visit type: perceived utility (encapsulating clinical and non-clinical utility), underlying costs (in terms of time, money, effort, and safety), modifiers (e.g., participants' clinical situation, choice availability, decision phenotype), and drivers (inclusive of their background experiences and digital environment). The relationship of these themes is depicted in a novel framework of patient choice around telehealth use. While visit utility and cost considerations are foundational to participants' decisions around whether to pursue care via telehealth, underappreciated modifiers and drivers often magnify or mitigate these considerations. Policymakers, payers, and health systems can leverage these factors to anticipate and enhance equitable high-value telehealth use in primary care settings among high-risk individuals.",patient choice;primary care;qualitative;telehealth,pandemic
Completion Rates and Timeliness of Diagnostic Colonoscopies for Rectal Bleeding in Primary Care.,"Rectal bleeding is the most common presenting symptom of colorectal cancer, and guidelines recommend timely follow-up, usually with colonoscopy to ensure timely diagnoses of colorectal cancer. Identify loop closure rates and vulnerable process points for patients with rectal bleeding. Retrospective cohort study, using medical record review of patients aged ≥ 40 with index diagnosis of rectal bleeding at 2 primary practices-an urban academic practice and affiliated community health center, between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020. Patients were classified as having completed recommended follow-up workup (""closed loop"") vs. not (""open loop""). Open loop patient cases were categorized into six types of process failures. A total of 837 patients had coded diagnoses of rectal bleeding within study window. Sixty-seven were excluded based on prior colectomy, clinical presentation more consistent with upper GI bleed, no rectal bleeding documented on chart review, or expired during the follow-up period, leaving 770 patients included. Primary outcomes were percentages of patient cases classified as ""open loops"" and distribution of these cases into six categories of process failure that were identified. 22.3% of patients (N = 172) failed to undergo timely recommended workup for rectal bleeding. Largest failure categories were patients for whom no procedure was ordered (N = 62, 36%), followed by patients with procedures ordered but never scheduled (N = 44, 26%) or scheduled but subsequently cancelled or not kept (N = 31, 18%). While open loops increased after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this difference was not significant within our study period. Significant numbers of patients presenting to primary care with rectal bleeding fail to undergo recommended workup. The majority either have no procedure ordered, or procedure ordered but never scheduled or cancelled and not kept, suggesting these are important failure modes to target in future interventions. Ensuring reliable ordering and processes for timely scheduling and completion of procedures represent critical areas for improving the diagnostic process for patients with rectal bleeding in primary care.",closed loop;diagnostic;diagnostic colonoscopy;open loop;quality;rectal bleeding,pandemic
Emerging and re-emerging pediatric viral diseases: a continuing global challenge.,"The twenty-first century has been marked by a surge in viral epidemics and pandemics, highlighting the global health challenge posed by emerging and re-emerging pediatric viral diseases. This review article explores the complex dynamics contributing to this challenge, including climate change, globalization, socio-economic interconnectedness, geopolitical tensions, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and disparities in access to healthcare resources. Understanding the interactions between the environment, socioeconomics, and health is crucial for effectively addressing current and future outbreaks. This scoping review focuses on emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases, with an emphasis on pediatric vulnerability. It highlights the urgent need for prevention, preparedness, and response efforts, particularly in resource-limited communities disproportionately affected by climate change and spillover events. Adopting a One Health/Planetary Health approach, which integrates human, animal, and ecosystem health, can enhance equity and resilience in global communities. IMPACT: We provide a scoping review of emerging and re-emerging viral threats to global pediatric populations This review provides an update on current pediatric viral threats in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic This review aims to sensitize clinicians, epidemiologists, public health practitioners, and policy stakeholders/decision-makers to the role these viral diseases have in persistent pediatric morbidity and mortality.",,pandemic
Unraveling the Link between Olfactory Deficits and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"Smell loss has caught public attention during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Research on olfactory function in health and disease gains new momentum. Smell deficits have long been recognized as an early clinical sign associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we review research on the associations between olfactory deficits and neuropathological conditions, focusing on recent progress in four areas: (1) human clinical studies of the correlations between smell deficits and neuropsychiatric disorders; (2) development of olfactory mucosa-derived tissue and cell models for studying the molecular pathologic mechanisms; (3) recent findings in brain imaging studies of structural and functional connectivity changes in olfactory pathways in neuropsychiatric disorders; and (4) application of preclinical animal models to validate and extend the findings from human subjects. Together, these studies have provided strong evidence of the link between the olfactory system and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the relevance of deepening our understanding of the role of the olfactory system in pathophysiological processes. Following the lead of studies reviewed here, future research in this field may open the door to the early detection of neuropsychiatric disorders, personalized treatment approaches, and potential therapeutic interventions through nasal administration techniques, such as nasal brush or nasal spray.",D006801:Humans;D012903:Smell;D000857:Olfaction Disorders;D058873:Pandemics;D000086382:COVID-19;D009831:Olfactory Mucosa,pandemic
Does student evaluation of on-demand video lectures vary with student characteristics? A questionnaire survey of medical students at Tokushima University.,"The popularity of online classes in university education has grown rapidly since the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aims to examine the association between the detailed characteristics/various contexts of students and the evaluation of online classes. An online questionnaire survey administered to third- and fourth-grade medical students of Tokushima University in September 2021-with 101 (42.8%) valid responses-showed the respondents' general impressions, comprehension, convenience, and desire for online classes even after the pandemic ends were significantly higher for the on-demand lectures than for simultaneous online classes. Notably, students who did not do other things while watching video lectures (10.9%) rated on-demand lectures as facilitating significantly higher impression, comprehension, and convenience than those who did other things (89.1%). A multivariate analysis revealed that students who did not do anything else while watching, whose waking time changed slightly, who commuted to school for shorter periods, who were not good at morning lectures, and who watched at high speed rated the video lectures highly. Thus, video lectures are appreciated by students who are committed to learning, which is a positive result for the future of on-demand education. J. Med.

"Impact of the Affordable Care Act on Prescription Contraceptive Use and Costs Among Privately Insured Women, 2006-2020.","In the years immediately following the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s contraceptive coverage requirement, out-of-pocket costs fell for all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods and use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) increased. This analysis examines whether these trends have continued through 2020 for privately insured women. Using 2006-2020 MarketScan data, we examined trends in prescription contraceptive use and out-of-pocket costs among women 13 to 49 years old. Multivariable analyses model the likelihood of contraceptive use and paying $0 post-ACA requirement (vs. pre-ACA requirement) for contraception, controlling for age group, U.S. region, urban versus rural, and cohort year. The likelihood of LARC insertion increased post-ACA requirement (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.127, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.121-1.133), with insertion rates peaking at 3.73% for intrauterine devices (IUDs) and 1.08% for implants in 2019, before declining with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Although the likelihood of paying $0 for LARC increased after the ACA requirement (IUD: aOR 5.495, 95% CI 5.278-5.716; implant: aOR 7.199, 95% CI 6.992-7.412), the proportion of individuals paying $0 declined to 69% for IUDs and 73% for implants in 2020, after having peaked at 88% in 2014 and 90% in 2016, respectively. For oral contraceptives, both use (aOR 1.028, 95% CI 1.026-1.030) and paying $0 (aOR 20.399, 95% CI 20.301-20.499) increased significantly after the ACA requirement. With the exception of oral contraceptives, the proportion of individuals paying $0 for all contraceptive methods declined after peaking in 2014 for IUDs, 2016 for the implant, and 2019 for non-LARC methods. Future monitoring is needed to understand the continuing impact of the ACA requirement on prescription contraceptive use and costs.",,pandemic
Evaluating a digital hybrid training-of-trainers (TOT) approach for lay first responder trauma education in urban Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the largest contributor to the global burden of injury, and in 2016 were among the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In regions with limited emergency medical services (EMS), training lay first responders (LFRs) has been shown to increase availability of prehospital care for RTIs, but sustainable mechanisms to scale these programs remain unstudied. Using a training of trainers (TOT) model, a 5.5-h LFR training program was launched in Lagos, Nigeria. The course was taught in a hybrid fashion with primary didactics using videoconferencing software and practical breakout sessions in-person concurrently. Thirty TOTs proceeded to train 350 transportation providers as LFRs over one month. A 23-question, pre- and post-assessment was administered digitally to assess knowledge acquisition. Participants responded to a five-point Likert survey assessing instruction quality and post-course confidence. TOTs scored a median of 56.5 % (IQR:43.5 %,71.7 %) and 91.3 % (IQR:88.0 %,95.7 %) on the pre- and post-assessments, respectively, with bleeding control scores increasing most (+69.4 %). LFR course trainees scored a median of 34.8 % (IQR: 26.0 %, 43.5 %) and 73.9 % (IQR: 65.2 %, 82.6 %) on the pre- and post-assessments respectively, with airway and breathing increasing the most (+48.6 %). All score increases were statistically significant with p < 0.001. All 30 TOT trainers instructed at least one training session after their initial session. LFR participants' rated confidence in first aid skills went from 3/5 (IQR 3, 4) pre-course to 5/5 (IQR:5,5) post-course, and in emergency transportation it went from 4/5 (IQR:3, 4) to 5/5 (IQR:5, 5), (p < 0.001). LFR course participants rated the quality of education content and TOT instructors to be 5/5 (IQR:5,5). 144 responders provided emergency care in the six-months following training for a total of 351 interventions. Active responders provided a median of 2 (IQR:1,3) interventions. This is the first time that a digital hybrid instruction for first responder trainers in low- and middle-income countries has been investigated. Our findings demonstrate negligible attrition, high educational quality ratings, equally effective knowledge acquisition to that of prior in-person courses, and high post-training skill usage. Future work will examine the cost-effectiveness of the training of LFRs and the effect of LFRs on trauma outcomes.",Acute care;First responder;Prehospital;Road traffic injury;Trauma care;Virtual education,pandemic
JCOA The Japanese Clinical Orthopaedic Association the questionnaire survey on the physical changes after the self-restraint of outdoor activities with the COVID-19 crisis (2nd report).,"In March 2021, the 3rd wave of COVID-19 pandemic had ended and the second emergency declaration in January in Tokyo and 3 other prefectures had been lifted. The restrictions on the social activities imposed on the Japanese people and it had become established as ""the new lifestyle norm"" for each age group. Following our first survey, we conducted a questionnaire survey again to determine the physical changes in all age groups and compared the findings. The 1st survey was conducted after the initial emergency declaration lifted in July 2020, and the 2nd survey was 10 months after the first survey March 2021. And the analysis was conducted by simple and cross tabulation. The number of valid responses were obtained over 12,000 samples for the both surveys. One year later, ""Corona locomo"" decreased from the previous year in all age groups, especially school students, while it increased in ""80s∼"". ""Corona stress"" decreased sharply among children, especially elementary school students, while it increased slightly in 20s, 30s, and ""80s∼"". The physical condition was closely related to the proportion of exercising population and duration in each age group. ""The new lifestyle norm"" as a countermeasure against COVID-19 crisis had a significant influence on physical condition in each age group as ""the secondary health damage"". Forcusing on ""With Corona era"", it is considered necessary for preventing ""locomo-frail"", to improve the exercise lifestyles by selecting tailor-made training methods.",COVID-19 crisis;Corona locomo;Corona stress;The questionnaire survey,pandemic
"Trends in vaping and nicotine product use among youth in Canada, England and the USA between 2017 and 2022: evidence to inform policy.","Preventing uptake of nicotine products among youth remains a central objective of tobacco control policy. Comparing trends in the use of nicotine across countries provides an opportunity to identify emergent product trends and to evaluate 'natural experiments' in policies. Repeat cross-sectional data were analysed from eight waves of the International Tobacco Control Youth Tobacco and Vaping Survey, conducted between 2017 and 2022. Non-probability samples of youth aged 16-19 years in Canada, England and the USA (N=104 473) completed online surveys including measures on vaping, smoking and use of other nicotine products. This paper summarises findings across the 5-year period of the study, as part of a comprehensive report on key indicators of youth vaping in the three countries. The youth nicotine market has rapidly evolved across the three countries, with different patterns of combustible and non-combustible product use in Canada, the USA and England. These changes are primarily attributable to trends in youth vaping: following declines during the initial COVID-19 pandemic period, by 2022, vaping prevalence neared pre-pandemic levels in the USA and Canada, and reached record highs in England. Notable shifts also occurred in the types of vaping products used by youth, including increased use of disposable, nicotine salt-based products. Additional findings are reported on a range of policy-relevant indicators, including for vaping products, promotions and purchasing. Patterns of nicotine use among youth have rapidly evolved in recent years due to the proliferation of nicotine products, the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging impact of policy measures.",Electronic nicotine delivery devices;Priority/special populations;Surveillance and monitoring,pandemic
Healthcare provider perspectives on COVID-19 vaccination for children in India.,"The rapid development and deployment of effective COVID-19 vaccines have been critical to halt the spread of the pandemic. India started vaccinating children in early 2022, however, vaccine uptake has been suboptimal. Between September and November 2022, we conducted an online survey that was disseminated to eligible participants via email, text messages and social media platforms across India. The survey aimed to gather the perspectives of Indian healthcare providers regarding key factors related to the rollout of paediatric COVID-19 vaccines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse participant demographics and responses on knowledge about paediatric COVID-19 vaccines, perceived risks and benefits, and vaccine rollout strategies. The survey yielded 805 respondents from 23 Indian states; 63.5% were men, 97.3% were paediatricians, median age was 44 years (IQR 25-81). Eighty-one per cent and 65.2% respondents had heard about the most common paediatric COVID-19 vaccines in India, Covaxin and Corbevax, but only 52.9%, 53.7% and 62.1% felt adequately informed about their safety, efficacy and vaccination schedules, respectively. Thirty per cent of respondents were unaware of vaccination guidelines. Eighty-five per cent of respondents felt that vaccines would reduce the incidence of severe disease, hospitalisation and deaths, and 60.6% felt children with comorbidities should be prioritised for vaccination. Perceived supply side barriers included lack of enforcement of guidelines (45.2%) and adverse effects following immunisation monitoring systems (37.6%), and on the demand side, parental vaccine hesitancy (64.4%). Eighty-one per cent believed that school-based vaccination strategies would be highly effective in increasing uptake. Most respondents were in support of the COVID-19 paediatric vaccination, although just over half did not feel adequately informed. Concerns about vaccine hesitancy among caregivers were the leading reported barrier. Targeted interventions are needed to provide adequate knowledge support to healthcare providers and evidence-based public health messaging to reduce vaccine hesitancy among caregivers.",D008297:Male;D006801:Humans;D002648:Child;D000328:Adult;D005260:Female;D000086663:COVID-19 Vaccines;D000086382:COVID-19;D014611:Vaccination;D006282:Health Personnel,pandemic
Association of Loneliness With Change in Physical and Emotional Health of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Shutdown.,"To examine factors influencing loneliness and the effect of loneliness on physical and emotional health, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prospective, observational cohort. Community-dwelling participants. Older adults (n = 238) enrolled in a longitudinal study. Interviews were completed July-December 2020. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA 3-item loneliness scale. Data including age, marriage, education, cognitive functioning, functional impairment, vision or hearing impairment, depression, anxiety, medical comorbidity, social network size, technology use, and activity engagement were collected. Health outcomes included self-rated health, and physical and mental composites from the 12-item Short Form Survey. Physical function was measured by a PROMIS-scaled composite score. Thirty-nine (16.4%) participants reported loneliness. Vulnerability factors for loneliness included age (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14); impairment with instrumental activities of daily living (RR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.14-3.80); vision impairment (RR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.10-3.97); depression (RR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.25-1.43); and anxiety (RR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.55-2.39). Significant resilience factors included high cognitive functioning (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94); large social network size (RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96); technology use (RR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.90); and social and physical activity engagement (RR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.98). Interaction analyses showed that larger social network size moderated the effect of loneliness on physical function (protective interaction effect, RR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.15-1.13, p <.01), and activity engagement moderated the effect of loneliness on mental health (protective interaction effect, RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.25-1.05, p <.001). Resilience factors may mitigate the adverse health outcomes associated with loneliness. Interventions to enhance resilience may help to diminish the detrimental effects of loneliness and hold great importance for vulnerable older adults.",D006801:Humans;D000368:Aged;D008132:Loneliness;D000086382:COVID-19;D008603:Mental Health;D008137:Longitudinal Studies;D058873:Pandemics;D000203:Activities of Daily Living;D011446:Prospective Studies,pandemic
COVID-19 and Spontaneous Resolution of Lumbar Disc Prolapse: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Patients Awaiting Microdiscectomy.,"Between individual patients with lumbar disc prolapse (LDP), the natural course of disease is significantly variable. Spontaneous resolution is reported to occur in up to 70% of cases. However, we currently cannot predict for whom and when this will occur. Neurosurgical intervention is indicated for LDP patients with non-tolerable pain after at least 8-12 weeks of conservative management, or significant neurological deficit. Channelling essential resources in the National Health Service (NHS) to fight the COVID-19 pandemic led to the postponement of most elective operations, including microdiscectomy. This left many LDP patients previously considered to be surgical candidates with conservative-only options in the interim. To our knowledge, we are the first centre to report the specific impact of the peri- and post-pandemic period on waiting list times, delayed elective microdiscectomy, and the incidence of spontaneous LDP resolution. Retrospective case series of a prospectively collected electronic departmental database identified LDP patients that would have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic at some point in their care pathway (March 2020 - February 2022). Further information was obtained from electronic patient records. 139 LDP patients were listed for elective microdiscectomy at the time of postponement of elective surgery. Over a third of LDP patients (n=47, 33.8%), in shared decision with the responsible neurosurgeon, had their re-scheduled microdiscectomy cancelled due to clinical improvement (14.1%), radiological regression (6.5%) or both (12.2%). Our single-centre retrospective analysis revealed that for over a third of LDP patients, the prolonged post-pandemic waiting list times for elective microdiscectomy resulted in their surgery not taking place either due to spontaneous clinical improvement or proven radiological regression. Considering this, a prolonged conservative approach to LDP may be appropriate in some patients - allowing time for natural resolution, whilst avoiding perioperative risks.",,pandemic
Intrahospital transmission and Infection Control of Candida auris Originating from a Severely Infected COVID-19 Patient Transferred Abroad.,"Intrahospital spread of Candida auris, which tenaciously survives in environments, can cause sustained colonization and infections. We experienced a large C. auris outbreak in intensive care units (ICUs) during the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The index patient with severe COVID-19, who was transferred from Vietnam in January 2022, developed C. auris candidaemia 10 days after hospitalization. From mid-June 2022 to January 2023, we implemented strengthened infection prevention and control (IPC) in three ICUs: (1) contact precautions and isolation (CPI) for C. auris-positive cases, (2) surveillance cultures including point-prevalence (N=718) for patients or close contacts or ICUs-resident healthcare workers (HCWs), (3) intensive environmental disinfection with 10-fold diluted bleach, and (4) 2% chlorhexidine bathing for all ICU patients. Environmental cultures (ECx) on surfaces and shared objects (N=276) were conducted until early September 2022, when all ECx were negative. Among 53 C. auris-positive patients between February 2022 and January 2023, invasive infections resulted in seven candidaemias and one pneumonia. C. auris was isolated from reusable tympanic thermometers (TTMs) contaminated with earwax. Isolation rate of C. auris in ECx decreased from 6.8% in June to 2.0% in August 2022 and was no longer detected in TTMs. Colonization in HCWs was remarkably rare (0.5%). The C. auris-positive patients reached a peak in July (N=10) but gradually decreased. By January 2023, no C. auris was isolated in the ICU. Aggressive IPC measures with CPI, cultures for environments and surveillance, decontamination of TTMs, and bathing were effective in successfully controlling C. auris outbreak.",COVID-19;Candida auris;Infection control;Intensive care unit;Outbreak;Tympanic thermometer,pandemic
Drug repurposing for the treatment of COVID-19: Targeting nafamostat to the lungs by a liposomal delivery system.,"Despite tremendous global efforts since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, still only a limited number of prophylactic and therapeutic options are available. Although vaccination is the most effective measure in preventing morbidity and mortality, there is a need for safe and effective post-infection treatment medication. In this study, we explored a pipeline of 21 potential candidates, examined in the Calu-3 cell line for their antiviral efficacy, for drug repurposing. Ralimetinib and nafamostat, clinically used drugs, have emerged as attractive candidates. Due to the inherent limitations of the selected drugs, we formulated targeted liposomes suitable for both systemic and intranasal administration. Non-targeted and targeted nafamostat liposomes (LipNaf) decorated with an Apolipoprotein B peptide (ApoB-P) as a specific lung-targeting ligand were successfully developed. The developed liposomal formulations of nafamostat were found to possess favorable physicochemical properties including nano size (119-147 nm), long-term stability of the normally rapidly degrading compound in aqueous solution, negligible leakage from the liposomes upon storage, and a neutral surface charge with low polydispersity index (PDI). Both nafamostat and ralimetinib liposomes showed good cellular uptake and lack of cytotoxicity, and non-targeted LipNaf demonstrated enhanced accumulation in the lungs following intranasal (IN) administration in non-infected mice. LipNaf retained its anti-SARS-CoV 2 activity in Calu 3 cells with only a modest decrease, exhibiting complete inhibition at concentrations >100 nM. IN, but not intraperitoneal (IP) treatment with targeted LipNaf resulted in trend to reduced viral load in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice compared to targeted empty Lip. Nevertheless, upon removal of outlier data, a statistically significant 1.9-fold reduction in viral load was achieved. This observation further highlights the importance of a targeted delivery into the respiratory tract. In summary, we were able to demonstrate a proof-of-concept of drug repurposing by liposomal formulations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The biodistribution and bioactivity studies with LipNaf suggest an IN or inhalation route of administration for optimal therapeutic efficacy.",COVID-19;Drug repurposing;Liposome;Nafamostat;Nanoparticles;SARS-CoV-2;Targeted delivery system,pandemic
Inhibitory effects of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and BNT162b2 vaccine on erythropoietin-induced globin gene expression in erythroid precursor cells (ErPCs) from β-thalassemia patients.,"During the recent COVID-19 pandemic several β-thalassemia patients have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and most patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies demonstrate an impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the hematopoietic system. The main objective of this study was to verify the effects of exposure of erythroid precursor cells (ErPCs) from β-thalassemia patients to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) and the BNT162b2 vaccine. Erythropoietin (EPO)-cultured ErPCs have been either untreated or treated with S-protein or BNT162b2 vaccine. The employed ErPCs were from a β-thalassemia cellular Biobank developed before the COVID-19 pandemic. The genotypes were β+-IVSI-110/β+-IVSI-110 (one patient),  β039/β+-IVSI-110 (three patients) and β039/ β039 (two patients). After 5 days treatment with S-protein or BNT162b2, lysates were analysed by HPLC, for hemoglobin production, and isolated RNA was assayed by RT-qPCR, for detection of globin gene expression. The main conclusions of the results obtained are that SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and BNT162b2 vaccine inhibit (a) fetal hemoglobin production by β-thalassemic ErPCs and (b) inhibit γ-globin mRNA accumulation. In addition, we have performed in silico studies suggesting a high affinity of S-protein to fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Remarkably, the binding interaction energy of fetal hemoglobin to S-protein was comparable to that of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of a relevant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination on the hematopoietic system.",COVID-19 vaccine;Fetal hemoglobin;SARS-CoV-2 Spike;β-thalassemia,pandemic

Establishing a 'Virtual' model of emergency care in Melbourne's southeast.,"Digital technologies, specifically those required to facilitate telehealth via an audiovisual medium, are now at a standard that allows them to reliably assess patients with acute complaints within their homes. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced innovation and led to an increased acceptance of telehealth from both clinicians and patients and presented an opportunity to incorporate telehealth into emergency medicine practice. With inpatient capacity strain exacerbated by the pandemic, three hospital networks within Melbourne's geographical southeast collaborated with Ambulance Victoria (AV) to set up a virtual emergency department (VED) service in January 2022. This service aimed to allow certain patients to receive care in the more convenient setting of their homes. Referrals were made directly by AV personnel at the home while they were attending to these patients. Consultation with a VED clinician was initiated through a secure audiovisual platform, 'Healthdirect'. Following this consultation, care could be facilitated at home through the VED clinician providing advice regarding treatment that paramedics could administer or through linkage into one of the various outreach services provided by the organisations. The VED represents part of the initial integration of telehealth into our organisations. We hope our initial framework might be built upon through greater integration with community services and incorporating more digital technologies. The ongoing graded expansion of telehealth services within our organisations will likely see more and more patients managed in their own homes.",,pandemic
Sex differences in ischemic stroke during COVID-19 first outbreak in northern Italy.,"COVID-19 pandemic had a great impact on outcome in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with ischemic stroke during the first wave in Italy. Few data are available on outcome stratified by sex. The Italian Society of Hospital Neuroscience conducted a multi-center, retrospective, observational study on neurological complications in COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke. All the patients admitted from March 1st to April 30th, 2020 in 20 Neurology Units in Northern Italy were recruited. Demographical and clinical features, treatment and outcome data were compared focusing on sex differences. 812 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled, of whom 129 with COVID-19; males were 53.8%. In-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients was 35.3% in males and 27.9% in females while 8.5% in male and 5.8% in female patients without COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had a higher frequency of stroke of undetermined etiology, than negative ones (32.8% vs 22.5%; p = 0.02), especially in females compared to males (36.1% vs 27.9%), albeit without statistical significance. Male patients with SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to require cPAP (30.9% vs 14.8%; p = 0.03), endotracheal tube (14.9% vs 3.3%; p = 0.02) and reperfusion strategies (29.4% vs 11.5%; p = 0.01) than females, as well as to have a higher CRP and D-dimer. These elements together with older age, a total anterior circulation stroke and lymphopenia were predictors of a worse outcome. Our study detected some differences due to sex in ischemic stroke with and without COVID-19, supporting the possibility to perform sex analyses for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients for a better clinical management.",COVID-19;Ischemic stroke;SARS-CoV-2;Sex differences,pandemic
COVID-19 and the impact on psychiatric and suicide-related emergency department visits of 5-18-year-Old youth in Israel.,"COVID-19 has been found to take a toll on the mental health of children and adolescents worldwide. This study retrospectively evaluated the changes in the number of general and suicide-related visits to a pediatric psychiatric emergency department (ED) at Geha Mental Health Center in Israel and the distribution of sex and age of the 5-18-year-old youth who visited the ED. The study looked at visits from the pre-pandemic years to the first and second years of the pandemic. The findings showed a sharp decrease in visits at the beginning of the pandemic, followed by a significant increase in the first year and a nonsignificant decline in the second year. The proportion of girls' ED visits was higher in the pandemic years compared to the pre-pandemic years. Regarding suicide-related visits, after a sharp decline at the beginning of the pandemic, the number of visits increased at a rate similar to the pre-pandemic period. We conclude that the pattern of change was similar to that of other population-level exposures to continuous stress conditions. Further research on the vulnerability of girls in similar situations is needed.",Adolescents;COVID-19;Emergency department;Stress;Suicidal Behavior;Suicidal ideation,pandemic
Ecological risk assessment of the typical anti-epidemic drugs in the Pearl River Delta by tracing their source and residual characteristics.,"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the anti-epidemic drugs have been used in extraordinary quantities with high intensity, and concerns have grown about their potential ecological risks due to their continued release and persistence in the receiving environments. A systematic investigation, covering the samples from hospital wastewater, effluent from wastewater treatment plants and receiving water bodies in the Pearl River Delta Region (PRDR), was carried out and aimed at tracing the sources and fate of 30 typical anti-epidemic in different water matrixes and evaluating their ecological risk. The results showed that these typical anti-epidemic drugs residues were detected in most of the sampling sites, with the highest concentration measured in hospital wastewater, whose concentrations were as high as ppb level, while the highest concentration of the surface water samples in tributaries was lower than ppb level. Anti-epidemic drugs contained in hospital wastewater and effluent from WWTPs were the main sources of drug residues in the surface water of this region. In the surface water of PRDR, although the detected concentration anti-epidemic drugs were basically in the range of 0-10 ng/L. The risk quotient of several anti-epidemic drugs, including Ciprofloxacin (CFX), Ofloxacin (OFX), Erythromycin (ETM), Clindamycin (CLI), and Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), was calculated to be a high value, which indicated that they might cause non-negligible ecological risk to the aquatic environment.",Anti-epidemic drugs;COVID-19 pandemic;Ecological risk assessment;Hospital wastewater;Pearl River Delta,pandemic
Burnout and turnover intention of primary health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.,"This study explored the changes and new characteristics of burnout and turnover intention of primary health care (PHC) providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. This was a cross-sectional study. This study investigated 1326 PHC providers during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 in one district of Shanghai, China. Independent t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test were used to analyse the between-group variation of variables associated to burnout and turnover intention. Then, hierarchical regression analysis was used to further determine the impact of certain variables on burnout and turnover intention, the relationship of burnout on turnover intention and the possible moderating effect. The results showed that there was no significant change in the prevalence of overall burnout of PHC providers compared to the pre-epidemic period; however, there was a significant increase in high-level burnout. No significant change in turnover intention at the moderate level and above was observed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, PHC providers who were older, married, local and had a higher skill level had higher burnout, while PHC providers who were male, unmarried, non-local and separated from their family had a higher turnover intention. It was shown that burnout, with its three sub-dimensions, was a good predictor of turnover intention. The impact of burnout on turnover intention was shown to be alleviated by certain variables, including being married, living locally and receiving benefit packages, including the preferential education policy for children and talent incentive policies. Results from this study have highlighted the importance of paying attention to vulnerable groups of PHC providers, for example those who are separated from their families, during emergency situations. Various incentive tools could be comprehensively used to ensure the stability and efficiency of PHC human resources.",Burnout;COVID-19;Primary health care;Turnover intention,pandemic
Monitoring COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia using SEIRD model parameters with MEWMA.,"When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Saudi Arabia, decision-makers were confronted with the difficult task of implementing treatment and disease prevention measures. To make effective decisions, officials must monitor several pandemic attributes simultaneously. Such as spreading rate, which is the number of new cases of a disease compared to existing cases; infection rate refers to how many cases have been reported in the entire population, and the recovery rate, which is how effective treatment is and indicates how many people recover from an illness and the mortality rate is how many deaths there are for every 10,000 people. Based on a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered Death (SEIRD) model, this study presents a method for monitoring changes in the dynamics of a pandemic. This approach uses a Bayesian paradigm for estimating the parameters at each time using a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The MCMC samples are then analyzed using Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Average (MEWMA) profile monitoring technique, which will ""signal"" if a change in the SEIRD model parameters change. The method is applied to the pre-vaccine COVID-19 data for Saudi Arabia and the MEWMA process shows changes in parameter profiles which correspond to real world events such as government interventions or changes in behaviour. The method presented here is a tool that researchers and policy makers can use to monitor pandemics in a real time manner.",Augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo;COVID-19 pandemic;Exponentially weighted moving average control;Multivariate control;Statistical process monitoring,pandemic
Development of a non-invasive ventilator for emergency and beyond.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to the development and implementation of emergency ventilators owing to the shortage of ventilators globally. Using invasive ventilators for patient intubation has medical experts concerned about increasing mortality. Early intervention with oxygen and respiratory therapy reduces the need for intubation, increases survival rates, and reduces the stress of critical care ventilators in hospitals. This study explores the capabilities of an easy-to-build and accessible non-invasive ventilator during an emergency and the practical implementation of the ventilator beyond the scope of the emergency. The proposed system consists of a high-pressure turbine integrated with a microcontroller and pressure and flow sensors assembled in a portable design. The non-invasive pressure support system is tested with a single-chamber high-precision lung simulator capable of simulating multiple lung diseases. The system is operated in a spontaneous pressure support mode as a Bi-level Ventilator for varying degrees of pressure level and lung conditions. The proposed study implements two most commonly adapted non-invasive patient circuits, i.e., single passive limb leak circuit and single limb active circuit. Both circuits are tested with and without leakage compensation. Two clinically accepted ventilation modes, i.e., pressure support and volume-assured pressure support ventilation, are presented. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using this type of device for non-invasive respiratory support and highlight the need for further testing to assess its safety and effectiveness in various clinical settings.",Non-invasive ventilation;Pressure support ventilation;Respiratory support;Volume assured pressure support,pandemic
A data-driven semi-parametric model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States.,"To support decision-making and policy for managing epidemics of emerging pathogens, we present a model for inference and scenario analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA. The stochastic SEIR-type model includes compartments for latent, asymptomatic, detected and undetected symptomatic individuals, and hospitalized cases, and features realistic interval distributions for presymptomatic and symptomatic periods, time varying rates of case detection, diagnosis, and mortality. The model accounts for the effects on transmission of human mobility using anonymized mobility data collected from cellular devices, and of difficult to quantify environmental and behavioral factors using a latent process. The baseline transmission rate is the product of a human mobility metric obtained from data and this fitted latent process. We fit the model to incident case and death reports for each state in the USA and Washington D.C., using likelihood Maximization by Iterated particle Filtering (MIF). Observations (daily case and death reports) are modeled as arising from a negative binomial reporting process. We estimate time-varying transmission rate, parameters of a sigmoidal time-varying fraction of hospitalized cases that result in death, extra-demographic process noise, two dispersion parameters of the observation process, and the initial sizes of the latent, asymptomatic, and symptomatic classes. In a retrospective analysis covering March-December 2020, we show how mobility and transmission strength became decoupled across two distinct phases of the pandemic. The decoupling demonstrates the need for flexible, semi-parametric approaches for modeling infectious disease dynamics in real-time.",,pandemic
Virtual Reality Distraction Is No Better Than Simple Distraction Techniques for Reducing Pain and Anxiety During Pediatric Orthopaedic Outpatient Procedures: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"In-office procedures can be painful and anxiety-provoking for pediatric patients. Minimizing such pain and anxiety in children improves the patient experience and promotes a rewarding and productive patient-caregiver-provider relationship, which may for some young patients be their first memorable encounter with the healthcare system. Although virtual reality (VR) techniques have proven to be helpful in minimizing pain and anxiety during procedures in pediatric intensive care settings, it remains unclear how VR affects objective and subjective measures of pain and anxiety in children undergoing in-office orthopaedic procedures such as cast removal or percutaneous pin removal after fracture healing. Is a VR gaming simulation more effective than either of two forms of noninteractive visual distraction (VR goggles or tablet computer displaying a noninteractive video) for reducing (1) objective measures of pain and anxiety and (2) subjective measures of pain and anxiety in children undergoing in-office cast removal or percutaneous pin removal? This study was a randomized controlled trial with two parallel, separately analyzed cohorts: children undergoing in-office cast removal or in-office percutaneous pin removal at a single urban tertiary institution. We approached eligible patients who were scheduled to undergo outpatient cast or percutaneous pin removal and who met prespecified inclusion criteria. We enrolled until 105 patients were available for analysis in each of the cast removal and pin removal cohorts. Of note, the study institution was in an urban epicenter of the coronavirus-19 pandemic, and clinical research was paused sporadically, which resulted in a longer-than-expected enrollment period. In the cast removal cohort, all patients were eligible for inclusion and were enrolled and randomized into one of three groups: VR gaming simulation (n = 37), VR goggles with a noninteractive video (n = 36), or a tablet computer with the same noninteractive video (n = 40). Eleven percent (4), 8% (3), and 3% (1) withdrew from each of the three intervention groups, respectively. In the pin removal cohort, all patients were eligible for inclusion and were enrolled and randomized into the same three groups (37, 44, and 41 patients, respectively). In the pin removal group, 14% (5), 18% (8), and 10% (4) withdrew from each of the three intervention groups, respectively. In all, 235 patients were enrolled in the study and 210 patients (mean ± SD age 9 ± 3 years; 48% [100] girls) were included in the final analyses. There were no clinically important differences in age, gender, preprocedure pain, or anxiety among the intervention groups. Primary outcomes included preprocedure-to-maximum heart rate increase (objective measure) and preprocedure and postprocedure pain and anxiety using a VAS (subjective measures). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons were used to calculate between-group differences for the primary outcomes. There were no intervention-level groupwise differences between VR goggles with an interactive game, VR goggles with a noninteractive video, or the tablet computer with the same video in preprocedure-to-maximum heart rate increase in the cast removal cohort (18 ± 21 bpm versus 14 ± 11 bpm versus 20 ± 16 bpm, respectively; largest mean difference -6 bpm [95% CI -16 to 3]; p = 0.36) or pin removal cohort (27 ± 20 bpm versus 23 ± 12 bpm versus 24 ± 19 bpm, respectively; largest mean difference 4 bpm [95% CI -7 to 14]; p = 0.99). Similarly, there were no intervention-level groupwise differences in preprocedure to postprocedure VAS pain in the cast removal cohort (1 ± 1 versus 1 ± 2 versus 0 ± 2, respectively; largest mean difference 0 points [95% CI 0 to 1]; p = 0.89) or pin removal cohort (0 ± 3 versus 2 ± 3 versus 0 ± 3 points, respectively; largest mean difference 1 point [95% CI 0 to 3]; p = 0.13). Finally, there were no intervention-level groupwise differences between the same intervention groups in preprocedure to postprocedure VAS anxiety in the cast removal cohort (-2 ± 2 versus -1 ± 2 versus -1 ± 2 points, respectively; largest mean difference -1 point [95% CI -2 to 1]; p = 0.63) or pin removal cohort (-3 ± 3 versus -4 ± 4 versus -3 ± 3 points, respectively; largest mean difference -1 point [95% CI -2 to 1]; p = 0.99). During in-office cast and pin removal in pediatric patients, simple distraction techniques such as tablet video viewing are as effective as higher-fidelity VR headset video and interactive games in minimizing objective measures of procedural pain and subjective measures of pain and anxiety. Because of these findings and because of the associated costs, implementation logistics, and variable tolerance by young patients, widespread use of VR distraction techniques in the pediatric orthopaedic outpatient setting is unnecessary.

Prioritization of surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: A qualitative exploration of patients' perspectives.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritizing certain surgical patients became inevitable due to limited surgical capacity. This study aims to identify which factors patients value in priority setting, and to evaluate their perspective on a decision model for surgical prioritization. We enacted a qualitative exploratory study and conducted semi-structured interviews with N = 15 patients. Vignettes were used as guidance. The interviews were transcribed and iteratively analyzed using thematic analysis. We unraveled three themes: 1) general attitude towards surgical prioritization: patients showed understanding for the difficult decisions to be made, but demanded greater transparency and objectivity; 2) patient-related factors that some participants considered should, or should not, influence the prioritization: age, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, behavior, waiting time, impact on survival and quality of life, emotional consequences, and resource usage; and 3) patients' perspective on a decision model: usage of such a model for prioritization decisions is favorable if the model is simple, uses trustworthy data, and its output is supervised by physicians. The model could also be used as a communication tool to explain prioritization dilemmas to patients. Support for the various factors and use of a decision model varied among patients. Therefore, it seems unrealistic to immediately incorporate these factors in decision models. Instead, this study calls for more research to identify feasible avenues and seek consensus.",D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D011788:Quality of Life;D058873:Pandemics;D010820:Physicians;D032921:Consensus,pandemic
Effects of internet-based telemonitoring platforms on the quality of life of oncologic patients: A systematic literature review protocol.,"Telemonitoring involves the transmission of clinical information through digital means, including internet-connected devices such as smartphones, health tracking apps and video conferencing platforms. This strategy could provide a viable alternative to facilitate follow-up in several conditions, including cancer. To synthesise the available evidence on the effectiveness of internet-based telemonitoring platforms amongst oncological patients. Relevant endpoints include overall quality of life, the ability to detect postoperative complications, severe toxicity reactions attributable to chemotherapy, reducing the frequency of hospitalisations, emergency department visits and mortality. A systematic review of published and unpublished randomised and controlled studies will be carried out. Iterative searches in PubMED/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, LILACS, and Cochrane CENTRAL repositories from January 2000 to January 2023 will be conducted. Grey literature repositories, such as Clinicaltrials, BioRxiv and MedRxiv will be searched as well. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess the quality of the eligible studies. If possible, a meta-analysis based on the random-effects model will be conducted to evaluate changes in any of the aforementioned outcomes. Heterogeneity will be assessed with Cochrane's Q and I2 statistics. Its exploration will be carried out using subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Relevant subgroups include the proportion of elderly patients in each study, characteristics of each platform, study type, type of funding and moment of conduction (i.e. before or after the COVID-19 pandemic).

Impact of COVID-19-related clinic closures on HIV incidence in a multicentre study of young adult MSM and transgender women in Kenya.,"Little is known about the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on risk of HIV acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the impact of COVID-19-related clinic closures on HIV incidence in a cohort of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW) in Kenya. MSM and TW enrolled in a prospective, multicenter cohort study were followed quarterly for HIV testing, behavior assessments, and risk. We estimated the HIV incidence rate (IR) and its 95% credible intervals (CrI) among participants who were HIV-negative before COVID-19-related clinic closure, comparing IR and risk factors associated with HIV acquisition before vs. after clinic reopening, using a Bayesian Poisson model with weakly-informative priors. A total of 690 (87%) participants returned for follow-up after clinic reopening [total person-years (PY) 664.3 during clinic closure and 1013.3 after clinic reopening]. HIV IR declined from 2.05/100PY (95%CrI = 1.22-3.26, n = 14) during clinic closures to 0.96/100PY (95%CrI = 0.41-2.07, n = 10) after clinic reopening (IRR = 0.47, 95%CrI = 0.20-1.01). The proportion of participants reporting hazardous alcohol use and several sexual risk behaviors was higher during clinic closures than after clinic reopening. In multivariable analysis adjusting for study site and participant characteristics, HIV incidence was lower after clinic reopening (IRR 0.57, 95%CrI = 0.23-1.33). Independent risk factors for HIV acquisition included receptive anal intercourse (IRR 1.94, 95%CrI = 0.88-4.80) and perceived risk of HIV (IRR 3.03, 95%CRI = 1.40-6.24). HIV incidence during COVID-19-related clinic closures was moderately increased and reduced after COVID-19 restrictions were eased.

Telerehabilitation use and experiences in occupational and physical therapy through the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Telehealth has helped to increase access to rehabilitative services such as occupational and physical therapy. The early COVID-19 pandemic amplified the need for remote access to care, and the rapid implementation of telehealth systems provided a unique opportunity to learn from clinicians' experiences adopting telehealth for telerehabilitation applications. To understand these experiences, a self-administered online survey was conducted to capture perspectives on ease of telerehabilitation use and adoption from occupational and physical therapists. The survey captured retrospective views on telerehabilitation use pre-pandemic as well as real-time perspectives on telerehabilitation during the early stages of the pandemic (July to August 2020). The survey gathered information on clinician demographics (N = 109), clinicians' experiences with adopting or utilizing telerehabilitation systems, and their perceptions on remotely performing cognitive, emotional, and physical assessments via video-conferencing (a common mode of telehealth). Responses demonstrated a modest increase in telerehabilitation as a care setting (rate increase from 3.4% to 19.3%), and telerehabilitation was more generally tried during the early stages of the pandemic (41 clinicians explicitly reported telerehabilitation use). However, technology access and acceptance remained low, with 38 clinicians (35%) expressing concerns that technology was ineffective or impractical, unavailable, not covered by insurance, or not desired by their patients. Video-conferencing technology was perceived as generally ill-equipped to support clinicians in performing remote assessment tasks. Physical assessment tasks were considered particularly difficult, with 55% of clinicians rating their ability to perform these tasks in the range of moderately difficult to unable to perform. To address these difficulties and better augment clinical care, clinicians require more robust assessment methods that may combine video, mobile, and wearable technologies that would be accessible to a patient at home. When designing future telerehabilitation tools, information captured through these modes must be task-relevant, standardized, and understandable to a remote clinician.",D006801:Humans;D000069350:Telerehabilitation;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D026741:Physical Therapy Modalities,pandemic

The Relationship Between Lockdowns and Video Game Playtime: Multilevel Time-Series Analysis Using Massive-Scale Data Telemetry.,"COVID-19 led governments worldwide to enact a variety of containment and closure policies. Substantial attention has been directed toward the idea that these public health measures may have unanticipated negative side effects. One proposed effect relates to video games. There is a nascent evidence base suggesting that individuals played video games for longer and in a more disordered manner during lockdowns and school closures specifically. These increases are commonly framed as a potential health concern in relation to disordered gaming. However, the evidence base regarding changes in gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic is based on self-report and, thus, is susceptible to bias. Therefore, it is unclear what the true consequences of lockdowns were for gaming behavior worldwide. The primary objective of this study was to estimate whether any specific lockdown policy led to meaningful increases in the amount of time individuals spent playing video games. Rather than relying on self-report, we used >251 billion hours of raw gameplay telemetry data from 184 separate countries to assess the behavioral correlates of COVID-19-related policy decisions. A multilevel model estimated the impact of varying enforcement levels of 8 containment and closure policies on the amount of time that individual users spent in-game. Similar models estimated the impact of policy on overall playtime and the number of users within a country. No lockdown policy can explain substantial variance in playtime per gamer. School closures were uniquely associated with meaningful increases in total playtime within a country (r2=0.048). However, this was associated with increases in the number of unique individuals playing games (r2=0.057) rather than increases in playtime per gamer (r2<0.001). Previous work using self-report data has suggested that important increases in heavy gaming may occur during pandemics because of containment and closure (""lockdown"") procedures. This study contrasts with the previous evidence base and finds no evidence of such a relationship. It suggests that significant further work is needed before increases in disordered or heavy gaming are considered when planning public health policies for pandemic preparedness.","D006801:Humans;D058873:Pandemics;D018910:Video Games;D016739:Behavior, Addictive;D000086382:COVID-19",pandemic
Effects of Distance-Learning Strategies in Dental Fixed Prosthodontics Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study on Preclinical Dental Students' Perspective.,"COVID-19's high transmissibility led to gathering restrictions where dental schools experienced disruptions due to restrictions on attending in-person lectures and limitations placed on applied preclinical and clinical activities. Students not only had to rapidly switch to digital technology-based learning (TB-learning) modules but also experienced high levels of social isolation and anxiety around virus transmission. This study aims to evaluate the preclinical students' perception of switching TB-learning modules amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying which module parameters were associated with strong student outcomes. A web-based survey of 39 Likert scale questions was delivered to preclinical dental students (Western University) to evaluate students' perceptions concerning TB-learning, fear amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact on their preclinical training. A Spearman rank correlation coefficient was determined to estimate the relationship between 2 variables in isolation (P=.01). An ordinal regression analysis was performed on variables of interest to determine how module variables (typically within the instructor's control) influenced the student outcomes (P=.05). The response rate was 30% (n=39). TB-learning was considered vital (34/39, 87.2%) as the students' education improved (18/39, 46.2%). However, 53.8% (n=21) of students showed increased difficulties in retaining, visualizing, or understanding the materials using TB-learning, and 64.1% (n=25) found it more difficult to concentrate than in in-person classes. In total, 79.5% (n=31) of students showed different levels of agreement about feeling fatigued from TB-learning. Through Spearman ρ correlation analysis, the quality of questions in quizzes (ρ=0.514; P<.001), relevant handouts (ρ=0.729; P<.001), and high-quality audiovisuals (ρ=0.585; P<.001) were positively correlated with students responding that the modules were useful to preclinical training. Similarly, good organization (ρ=0.512; P<.001), high-quality questions in quizzes (ρ=0.431; P=.01), and relevant handouts (ρ=0.551; P<.001) were positively correlated with web-based classes as an effective way to learn. In total, 91.6% (n=36) of the students agreed that COVID-19 was a dangerous disease, whereas 53.8% (n=21) showed different levels of agreement that they were afraid to be infected personally, and 69.2% (n=27) feared passing COVID-19 along to family and friends. A total of 82.1% (n=32) of the students showed that COVID-19 impacted their overall learning process and had a negative impact on their practical preclinical training (31/39, 79.5%). The students found a difference between TB-learning and face-to-face learning methods, where the students perceived fatigue toward the web-based method with difficulty concentrating and visualizing the subject. Moreover, there was a consensus that COVID-19 itself affected the students' overall learning process and preclinical training. As dental schools continue implementing TB-learning into their curriculum, this investigation identifies the students' struggles with the paradigm shift. In an effort to improve TB-learning, this work highlights 4 variables (organization, quizzes, quality handouts, and quality audiovisuals) within the control of instructors that can help improve content deliverance, improving the students' experience.",COVID-19;dental;dental education;dental school;dentist;dentistry;distance learning;education;isolation;mental health;module;online learning;online teaching;pre-clinical training;student perception;survey;teaching;teaching methods;technology-based learning;training;transmissibility,pandemic
Factors Influencing the Acceptance and Adoption of Mobile Health Apps by Physicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of and access to health care have been uniquely challenging, particularly during lockdowns or when dealing with COVID-19 cases. Health care professionals have had to provide patients with the necessary health care. However, delivering health care services while reducing face-to-face interaction puts an immense strain on health systems that are already overburdened. Against this backdrop, it is now more critical than ever to ensure the accessibility of health care services. Such access has been made increasingly available through mobile health (mHealth) apps. These apps have the potential to significantly improve health care outcomes and expectations and address some of the challenges confronting health care systems worldwide. Despite the advantages of mHealth, its acceptance and adoption remain low. Hence, health care organizations must consider the perceptions and opinions of physicians if the technology is to be successfully implemented. The objective of this systematic review was to explore and synthesize the scientific literature on the factors influencing the acceptance and adoption of mHealth among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review of the studies published between March 2020 and December 2022 was conducted using the MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and ProQuest databases. The database search yielded an initial sample of 455 potential publications for analysis, of which 9 (2%) met the inclusion criteria. The methodology of this review was based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The factors influencing mHealth acceptance and adoption by physicians were divided into perceived barriers and perceived facilitators, which were further grouped into the following 3 major thematic categories: technological, individual, and organizational barriers and facilitators, respectively. The technological barriers were accessibility, technical issues, usefulness, and data management; individual barriers were perceived patient barriers, time and workload pressure, technical literacy, knowledge of mHealth, and peer support; and organizational barriers were financial factors, management support and engagement, data security, telemonitoring policy, and collaboration. The technological facilitators of uptake were technical factors, clinical usefulness, and data management; individual facilitators were patient-related care, intrinsic motivation, collaboration, and data sharing (individual); and organizational facilitators were workflow-related determinants, organizational financial support, recommendation of mHealth services, and evidence-based guidelines. This review summarized the evidence on the factors influencing mHealth acceptance and adoption by physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main findings highlighted the importance of addressing organizational readiness to support physicians with adequate resources, shifting the focus from technological to patient-centered factors, and the seamless integration of mHealth into routine practice during and beyond the pandemic.

A Year After Implementation of the Telehealth Waiver: Being Offered and Utilizing Video-Specific Telehealth Among Dual-Eligible Medicare Recipients During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Telehealth is an essential tool to provide access to care while reducing infection exposure for high-risk populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aims to examine factors associated with telehealth availability and usage among Medicare and dual-eligible recipients 1 year after implementation of the Medicare's temporary telehealth waiver. A cross-sectional, phone survey with a national representative sample of Medicare recipients. We obtained a final study sample from the Winter 2021 COVID-19 Supplement of Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey dataset (N = 10 586). We examined associations for being offered and having had telehealth visits or any video telehealth visits during the pandemic since November 1, 2020. Our primary outcomes were being offered any telehealth, being offered any video telehealth, having had any telehealth visit, and having had any video telehealth. Although dual eligibility was not significantly associated with being offered or having had any telehealth services during the pandemic, those who were dual eligible were more likely to have had video telehealth visits (adjusted odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.86, P = .03) compared with those with non-dual eligibility. Recipients with disability eligibility, technology access, and severe chronic conditions were more likely to have been offered or have had telehealth. At the same time, those who lived in the nonmetropolitan area were less likely to have been offered or have had telehealth, including video telehealth. Our findings suggest that the federal waivers to expand telehealth services were successful in continuing care for vulnerable Medicare recipients. The providers' specific outreach and intervention efforts to offer telehealth visits are crucial for dual-eligible recipients. To increase video telehealth uptake, technology access and services to rural areas should be prioritized.",,pandemic
The one health perspective to improve environmental surveillance of zoonotic viruses: lessons from COVID-19 and outlook beyond.,"The human population has doubled in the last 50 years from about 3.7 billion to approximately 7.8 billion. With this rapid expansion, more people live in close contact with wildlife, livestock, and pets, which in turn creates increasing opportunities for zoonotic diseases to pass between animals and people. At present an estimated 75% of all emerging virus-associated infectious diseases possess a zoonotic origin, and outbreaks of Zika, Ebola and COVID-19 in the past decade showed their huge disruptive potential on the global economy. Here, we describe how One Health inspired environmental surveillance campaigns have emerged as the preferred tools to monitor human-adjacent environments for known and yet to be discovered infectious diseases, and how they can complement classical clinical diagnostics. We highlight the importance of environmental factors concerning interactions between animals, pathogens and/or humans that drive the emergence of zoonoses, and the methodologies currently proposed to monitor them-the surveillance of wastewater, for example, was identified as one of the main tools to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by public health professionals and policy makers during the COVID-19 pandemic. One-Health driven approaches that facilitate surveillance, thus harbour the potential of preparing humanity for future pandemics caused by aetiological agents with environmental reservoirs. Via the example of COVID-19 and other viral diseases, we propose that wastewater surveillance is a useful complement to clinical diagnosis as it is centralized, robust, cost-effective, and relatively easy to implement.",,pandemic
Cell-free biosynthesis combined with deep learning accelerates de novo-development of antimicrobial peptides.,"Bioactive peptides are key molecules in health and medicine. Deep learning holds a big promise for the discovery and design of bioactive peptides. Yet, suitable experimental approaches are required to validate candidates in high throughput and at low cost. Here, we established a cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) pipeline for the rapid and inexpensive production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) directly from DNA templates. To validate our platform, we used deep learning to design thousands of AMPs de novo. Using computational methods, we prioritized 500 candidates that we produced and screened with our CFPS pipeline. We identified 30 functional AMPs, which we characterized further through molecular dynamics simulations, antimicrobial activity and toxicity. Notably, six de novo-AMPs feature broad-spectrum activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens and do not develop bacterial resistance.

Ethics and Health Security in the Australian COVID-19 Context: A Critical Interpretive Literature Review.,"Background The concept of ""health security"" is often used to motivate public health responses, yet the ethical values that underpin this concept remain largely unexamined. The recent Australian responses to COVID-19 serve as an important case study by which we can analyse the pre-existing literature to see what ethical values shaped, and continue to shape, Australia's response. Methods We conducted a critical interpretive literature review of academic and grey literatures within key databases, resulting in 2,220 sources. After screening for duplicates and relevance, we analysed ninety-six sources. Results First, risk and uncertainty are a leading focus, with a heavy concentration on risks to life and health. Second, free movement, safety, and security were recurringly emphasized, albeit narrowly focused upon the safety of the population. Third, legitimacy was a recurring theme, and it is here that discussions of ""health security"" figured highly. Conclusion Discussions of harm from government and associated official bodies fail to adequately distinguish between various senses of harm. Moreover, while the literature often discusses the balancing of rights, the steps involved in the weighing of these rights is rarely adequately explained and defended. We suggest that decision-makers should endeavour to clearly identify and defend the values undergirding their decisions in the public sphere.",Governance;Harm;Pandemic;Safety;Security;Transparency,pandemic
"Adult Mental Health Presentations to Emergency Departments in Victoria, Australia between January 2018 and October 2020: Changes Associated with COVID-19 Pandemic Public Health Restrictions.","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures altered patterns of help-seeking for mental health, with increases in emergency department utilisation reported. We examined the association between COVID-19 restrictions and adult emergency department (ED) mental health presentations in Victoria, Australia, through secondary analysis of data from 39 public EDs across the state. Participants were all patients (18+ years) presenting between 1 January 2018 and 31 October 2020 with mental health or intentional self-harm. The main outcome was number of presentations for each mental health condition, by patient age, socioeconomic status (SES), location, and ED triage category. We used a Poisson regression model to compare predicted monthly ED presentations based on trends from 2018, 2019 and 2020 (up to 31 March), with observed presentations during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 April to 31 October 2020). There was an average of 4,967 adult mental health presentations per month pre-COVID-19 (1 January-31 March 2020) and 5,054 per month during the COVID-19 period (1 April-31 October 2020). Compared to predicted incidence, eating disorder presentations increased 24.0% in the COVID-19 period, primarily among higher SES females aged 18-24 years. Developmental/behavioural disorder presentations decreased by 19.7% for all age groups. Pandemic restrictions were associated with overall increases in monthly adult ED presentations for mental health, with some disorders increasing and others decreasing. Accessibility of acute mental health services needs to be addressed to meet changing demand and ensure services are responsive to changes in presentations resulting from future public health challenges.",Adult;Australia;COVID-19;Emergency department;Lockdown;Mental health;Victoria,pandemic
COVID-19-Related Outcomes Among Group Home Residents with Serious Mental Illness in Massachusetts in the First Year of the Pandemic.,"This study examined COVID-19 infection and hospitalizations among people with serious mental illness who resided in residential care group homes in Massachusetts during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors analyzed data on 2261 group home residents and COVID-19 data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Outcomes included positive COVID-19 tests and COVID-19 hospitalizations March 1, 2020-June 30, 2020 (wave 1) and July 1, 2020-March 31, 2021 (wave 2). Associations between hazard of outcomes and resident and group home characteristics were estimated using multi-level Cox frailty models including home- and city-level frailties. Between March 2020 and March 2021, 182 (8%) residents tested positive for COVID-19, and 51 (2%) had a COVID-19 hospitalization. Compared with the Massachusetts population, group home residents had age-adjusted rate ratios of 3.0 (4.86 vs. 1.60 per 100) for COVID infection and 13.5 (1.99 vs. 0.15 per 100) for COVID hospitalizations during wave 1; during wave 2, the rate ratios were 0.5 (4.55 vs. 8.48 per 100) and 1.7 (0.69 vs. 0.40 per 100). In Cox models, residents in homes with more beds, higher staff-to-resident ratios, recent infections among staff and other residents, and in cities with high community transmission risk had greater hazard of COVID-19 infection. Policies and interventions that target group home-specific risks are needed to mitigate adverse communicable disease outcomes in this population.Clinical Trial Registration Number This study provides baseline (i.e., pre-randomization) data from a clinical trial study NCT04726371.",COVID-19;Congregate living environments;Group homes;Serious mental illness,pandemic
Comparative Study of the Long-Term Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Nutritional Practices Among International Elite and Sub-Elite Athletes: A Sample of 1420 Participants from 14 Countries.,"Although several studies have shown that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown has had negative impacts on mental health and eating behaviors among the general population and athletes, few studies have examined the long-term effects on elite and sub-elite athletes. The present study aimed to investigate the long-term impact of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health and eating behaviors in elite versus sub-elite athletes two years into the pandemic. A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted between March and April 2022, involving athletes from 14 countries, using a convenient non-probabilistic and snowball sampling method. A total of 1420 athletes (24.5 ± 7.9 years old, 569 elites, 35% women, and 851 sub-elites, 45% women) completed an online survey-based questionnaire. The questionnaire included a sociodemographic survey, information about the COVID-19 pandemic, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) for mental health assessment, and the Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants (REAP-S) for assessing eating behavior. The results showed that compared to sub-elite athletes, elite athletes had lower scores on the DASS-21 (p = .001) and its subscales of depression (p = .003), anxiety (p = .007), and stress (p < .001), as well as a lower REAP-S score indicating lower diet quality (p = .013). In conclusion, two years into the pandemic, elite athletes were likelier to have better mental health profiles than sub-elite athletes but surprisingly had lower diet quality.",Athlete;Health;Infectious disease;Nutrition;Performance,pandemic
"Relationships Between Mental Health, Negative Feelings of COVID-19, and Parenting Among Pregnant Women in Fortaleza, Brazil.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the literature highlighted an increased risk of child abuse and the use of negative parenting practices. Furthermore, pregnancy during this time may have been challenging and generated different feelings regarding the pandemic and motherhood. Many pregnant women had other young children, underscoring the need to understand this scenario better. Therefore, the present study examined the predictive effect of indicators of mental health disorders, emotional discomfort with motherhood, and negative perceptions of COVID-19 on negative parenting practices. The study used a cross-sectional design. Pregnant women (n = 303) who had other children younger than six years answered an online questionnaire during the physical distancing period due to COVID-19 in Fortaleza. A partially latent structural equation model (SEM) was used to test direct and indirect relations between the variables. The results revealed a direct positive relation between maternal mental health and the variables COVID-19 feelings, emotional discomfort with motherhood, and negative parenting practices. The stronger relationship was between maternal mental health and emotional discomfort with motherhood. The COVID-19 negative feelings also showed a direct positive relation to emotional discomfort with motherhood. Additionally, older mothers and those with fewer children tended to have less mental health disorders. Furthermore, being in a later trimester of pregnancy was linked to more negative feelings about motherhood. The study suggests that mothers experiencing mental health challenges are more likely to feel discomfort with motherhood and use negative parenting practices, highlighting a need for intervention.",COVID-19;Maternal Mental Health;Pandemic;Parenting Practices;Pregnant Women,pandemic
Cesarean Delivery Outcomes for Patients with Coronavirus Disease-2019 in the USA.,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) may have increased morbidity and mortality in patients having Cesarean delivery (CD) in the USA. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who had CD in 2020 using the national inpatient sample. After stratification by COVID-19 status, demographics, comorbidities, complications, mortality, and costs were compared. There were 31,444,222 hospitalizations in the USA in 2020 with a mortality rate of 2.8%. Among these, 1,453,945 patients had COVID-19 and mortality was 13.2%. There were 1,108,755 patients who had CD and 15,550 had COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 more frequently had Medicaid and were Hispanic. Patients with COVID-19 had more comorbidities including chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia. Mortality in CD patients with COVID-19 was 30 in 10,000 patients, while for non-COVID-19 patients, it was 1 in 10,000 patients, P < 0.001. The crude odds ratio for mortality in COVID-19 patients was 32.1 (95% confidence interval = 22.9 to 44.7), P < 0.001 and the adjusted odds ratio was 29.3 (95% confidence interval = 20.7 to 41.4), P < 0.001. CD patients with COVID-19 had 30-fold higher mortality before widespread vaccination was available with Hispanic and Medicaid patients disproportionately impacted. Potential explanations for this disparity include reduced access to personal protective equipment (e.g., masks) and testing, as well as socio-economic factors. Further research is needed to understand the factors that contributed to disparities in infection and clinical outcomes among obstetric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In future pandemics, enhanced efforts will be needed to protect economically disadvantaged women who are pregnant.",COVID-19;Disparities;Obstetrics;Women’s health,pandemic
Cross-cultural invariance of the Spanish version of the COVID-19 Assessment Scorecard to measure the perception of government actions against COVID-19 in Latin America.,"The present study aimed to evaluate the measurement invariance of a general measure of the perception of governmental responses to COVID-|19 (COVID-SCORE-10) in the general population of 13 Latin American countries. A total of 5780 individuals from 13 Latin American and Caribbean countries selected by non-probabilistic snowball sampling participated. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed and the alignment method was used to evaluate invariance. Additionally, a graded response model was used for the assessment of item characteristics. The results indicate that there is approximate measurement invariance of the COVID-SCORE-10 among the participating countries. Furthermore, IRT results suggest that the COVID-SCORE-10 measures with good psychometric ability a broad spectrum of the construct assessed, especially around average levels. Comparison of COVID-SCORE-10 scores indicated that participants from Cuba, Uruguay and El Salvador had the most positive perceptions of government actions to address the pandemic. Thus, the underlying construct of perception of government actions was equivalent in all countries. The results show the importance of initially establishing the fundamental measurement properties and MI before inferring the cross-cultural universality of the construct to be measured.",Alignment method;COVID-19;COVID-SCORE-10;Invariance;Latin America,pandemic
"""It took so much of the humanness away"": Health care professional experiences providing care to dying patients during COVID-19.","COVID-19 has affected healthcare in profound and unprecedented ways, distorting the experiences of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) alike. One area that has received little attention is how COVID-19 affected HCPs caring for dying patients. The goal of this study was to examine the experiences of HCPs working with dying patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between July 2020-July 2021, we recruited HCPs (N = 25) across Canada. We conducted semi-structured interviews, using a qualitative study design rooted in constructivist grounded theory methodology. The core themes identified were the impact of the pandemic on care utilization, the impact of infection control measures on provision of care, moral distress in the workplace, impact on psychological wellbeing, and adaptive strategies to help HCPs manage emotions and navigate pandemic imposed changes. This is the first Canadian study to qualitatively examine the experiences of HCPs providing care to dying patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications include informing supportive strategies and shaping policies for HCPs providing palliative care.",,pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic and changes in spatio-temporal patterns of suicide: monthly variations among localities in Argentina.,"The aim of this study was to assess space-time clustering of suicide in Argentina between 2017 and 2020. A spatio-temporal scan statistic using a space-time permutation model was employed to retrospectively detect clusters of total suicides by sex and by age group. From 2017 to 2020, six statistically significant spatio-temporal clusters were identified in Argentina with either more or less suicides than expected. Two clusters extended from May 2019 to July and September 2020, while the remaining four clusters were detected only during 2020. The start of the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have changed the spatio-temporal patterns of suicide in Argentina. Despite the national decrease in the number of suicides during 2020 compared to previous years, the spatio-temporal analysis revealed both areas with decreases and increases in suicide. This heterogeneous scenario highlights the need for the study of local effects behind the emergence of these spatio-temporal suicide clusters.",COVID-19;Pandemics;spatial analysis;spatio-temporal clustering;suicide;tourism,pandemic
COVID-19 infection and ambulatory surgery: Decision making based on known knowns.,"During the spring of 2020, as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections rapidly spread across the globe, all sectors of healthcare, everywhere, would change in ways that were unimaginable. Early on, the ambulatory surgery space, being no exception, would suffer deep and impactful reductions in patient volume and revenue. Though actual care stoppages were short-lived, decreased ambulatory surgical patient volumes continued for a myriad of reasons, though in some cases, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) provided surgical care in limited numbers to patients who were ""offloaded"" from inpatient lists. Released on March 24, 2020, herein, we address the key perioperative issues as they relate to COVID-19 and ambulatory surgery including the many complexities and challenges of a new and rapidly changing virus, the impact of viral infection and vaccine development on perioperative outcomes, key ambulatory surgical approaches to COVID-19-related patient and staff safety, and finally, managing issues related to both supply chain (personal protective equipment (PPE) and other necessary equipment) and facility staffing.",D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D000556:Ambulatory Surgical Procedures;D000067393:Personal Protective Equipment;D000078329:Workforce;D003657:Decision Making,pandemic

Assessing airborne transmission risks in COVID-19 hospitals by systematically monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in the air.,"The continuous emergence of highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants with the capability of immune evasion demands more effective risk assessment and management approaches for infection prevention and control. Controlling nosocomial transmission is critical in response to the COVID-19 pandemic upon the resumption of day-to-day activities. Here, we systematically analyzed the presence of airborne SARS-CoV-2 in the isolation ward and within the contaminant, emergency, and clean zones of a designated COVID-19 hospital. A total of 359 air samples collected in the clean and emergency zones tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating the interruption of airborne transmission in a designated COVID-19 hospital by combining the closed-loop management, unidirectional airflow, and negative pressure of isolation wards. In contrast, some air samples in the corridor outside the isolation wards tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The leakage of virus-containing air from patient rooms to adjoining areas during rounds and meal delivery sheds light on the need for intensive and widespread virus monitoring in designated COVID-19 hospitals. In conclusion, by systematically monitoring viruses in the air, the study provides a starting point for the standardization of transmission risk management in designated hospitals for the future pandemic of a newly emerged respiratory infectious disease.IMPORTANCERisk management and control of airborne transmission in hospitals is crucial in response to a respiratory virus pandemic. However, the formulation of these infection control measures is often based on epidemiological investigations, which are an indirect way of analyzing the transmission route of viruses. This can lead to careless omissions in infection prevention and control or excessively restrictive measures that increase the burden on healthcare workers. The study provides a starting point for standardizing transmission risk management in designated hospitals by systemically monitoring viruses in the air of typical spaces in COVID-19 hospitals. The negative results of 359 air samples in the clean and emergency zones demonstrated the existing measures to interrupt airborne transmission in a designated COVID-19 hospital. Some positive cases in the corridor of the contaminant zone during rounds and meal delivery highlighted the importance of monitoring airborne viruses for interrupting nosocomial infection.",SARS-CoV-2;aerosol;airborne transmission;designated COVID-19 hospital;nosocomial transmission,pandemic
The value of observational registry studies for the next infectious disease emergency.,"During infectious disease emergencies, it may be necessary to deploy new therapies without conclusive evidence for their effectiveness.

Those registries provided evidence that CCP was effective when used early and with high titer.",clinical trials;coronavirus;neutralizing antibodies,pandemic
Seasonality of endemic COVID-19.,"Successive waves of infection by SARS-CoV-2 have left little doubt that this virus will transition to an endemic disease. Foreknowledge of when to expect seasonal surges is crucial for healthcare and public health decision-making. However, the future seasonality of COVID-19 remains uncertain. Evaluating its seasonality is complicated due to the limited years of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, pandemic dynamics, and varied interventions. In this study, we project the expected endemic seasonality by employing a phylogenetic ancestral and descendant state approach that leverages long-term data on the incidence of circulating HCoV coronaviruses. Our projections indicate asynchronous surges of SARS-CoV-2 across different locations in the northern hemisphere, occurring between October and January in New York and between January and March in Yamagata, Japan. This knowledge of spatiotemporal surges leads to medical preparedness and enables the implementation of targeted public health interventions to mitigate COVID-19 transmission.IMPORTANCEThe seasonality of COVID-19 is important for effective healthcare and public health decision-making. Previous waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections have indicated that the virus will likely persist as an endemic pathogen with distinct surges. However, the timing and patterns of potentially seasonal surges remain uncertain, rendering effective public health policies uninformed and in danger of poorly anticipating opportunities for intervention, such as well-timed booster vaccination drives. Applying an evolutionary approach to long-term data on closely related circulating coronaviruses, our research provides projections of seasonal surges that should be expected at major temperate population centers. These projections enable local public health efforts that are tailored to expected surges at specific locales or regions. This knowledge is crucial for enhancing medical preparedness and facilitating the implementation of targeted public health interventions.",COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2;evolution;seasonality,pandemic
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PICU admissions for severe asthma exacerbations: A single-center experience.,"The incidence of severe asthma exacerbations (SAE) requiring a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (and its association with public restrictions) is largely unknown. We examined the trend of SAE requiring PICU admission before, during, and after COVID-19 restrictions in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and its relationship with features such as environmental triggers and changes in COVID-19 restriction measures. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, all PICU admissions of children aged ≥2 years for severe asthma at the Amsterdam UMC between 2018 and 2022 were included. The concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and pollen were obtained from official monitoring stations. Between January 2018 and December 2022, 228 children were admitted to the PICU of the Amsterdam UMC for SAE. While we observed a decrease in admissions during periods of more stringent restriction, there was an increase in the PICU admission rate for SAE in some periods following the lifting of restrictions. In particular, following the COVID-19 restrictions in 2021, we observed a peak incidence of admissions from August to November, which was higher than any other peak during the indicated years. No association with air pollution or pollen was observed. We hypothesize that an increase in clinically diagnosed viral infections after lockdown periods was the reason for the altered incidence of SAE at the PICU in late 2021, rather than air pollution and pollen concentrations.",COVID-19;PICU;SARS-CoV-2;asthma exacerbation;children;incidence;pandemic;severe asthma,pandemic
"Changes in clinical, demographic, and outcome patterns of children hospitalized with non-SARS-CoV-2 viral low respiratory tract infections before and during the COVID pandemic in Rome, Italy.","We performed this study aiming to evaluate changes in epidemiology, clinical presentation and outcomes of children hospitalized for viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). We performed a retrospective study of children younger than 18 years of age hospitalized for LRTIs with a positive respiratory viral testing from 2018 to 2022. We compared need of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), invasive ventilation, and other respiratory support, viral etiologies, clinical presentations, imaging, and laboratory results in the precovid (2018-2019) and covid (2020-2022) period. A total of 523 were included in the analysis. In the pandemic period, the detection of influenza was 95% less likely to occur (odds ratio [OR]: 0.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.02-0.12; p < .001), likewise the detection of adenovirus was 77% less likely to occur (OR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.10-0.51; p < .001). In the pandemic period, the number of codetections increased from 15.52% in 2018 to 57.25% in 2022, resulting in a significantly increasing trend (p < .001). The odds of transfer to PICU was more than five times greater during the pandemic period (OR: 5.31; 95% CI: 1.78-15.86; p = .003).

COVID-19 Pandemic Effects on Clinical Outcomes of Hip Fractures Among Pediatric and Adult Patients.,"Little is known about the distribution and outcomes of hip fractures in pediatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the clinical outcomes of both pediatric and adult patients who underwent hip fracture surgeries and determine the effects of changes surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Both pediatric and adult surgical hip fracture cases were analyzed from the pandemic year (2020) and the control year (2019) using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Between the prepandemic (control) and pandemic years, a total of 2,438 pediatric and 28,180 adult cases were compared. Pediatric patients had similar perioperative characteristics and outcomes between the two years. Significantly fewer hip fractures were reported among adults during the pandemic (p < .001). Preoperatively, more adult patients had ventilator dependence (p = .020), transfusions (p = .029), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (p < .001) in 2020. Adult operations were more likely to be emergent in 2020 (p < .001) and adults had more severe disease states. Length of stay (p < .001) and the time from operation to discharge (p < .001) were significantly longer for the adult cohort in 2020. Mortality was also higher for adults during the first year of the pandemic (p = .003), and superficial surgical site infections became more common (p = .036). Pediatric hip fracture patients had similar clinical outcomes between 2019 and 2020. Adults with hip fractures presented in more serious clinical conditions, which resulted in higher mortality in 2020. Further studies could better clarify the reasons as to why adult hip fracture patients had markedly worse clinical course during the COVID year than pediatric patients.",D006801:Humans;D000328:Adult;D002648:Child;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D007902:Length of Stay;D006620:Hip Fractures,pandemic
Mobile Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines to Migrant Farmworkers in Minnesota.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted migrant farmworkers (MFWs). MFWs have experienced higher rates of infection and death than any other occupational group in the United States due to workplace exposure risks, overcrowded housing, and limited access to personal protective equipment. Barriers to accessing COVID-19 vaccines have also contributed to these disparities, especially in rural areas where the pandemic's impact has been devastating. Mobile health clinics, in partnership with community-based organizations, are an effective method for vaccine distribution to rural communities where many MFWs live and work. Between June 2021 and October 2022, the University of Minnesota's Mobile Health Initiative (MHI) organized health fairs in southern Minnesota to distribute vaccines to MFWs and their families. The success of these events can be attributed to partnering with trusted local organizations, bridging geographic barriers, ensuring language-concordant care, and offering multiple health services in one place. MHI's health fairs serve as a model for future mobile vaccination events. As the COVID-19 pandemic has ended as of this time, future pandemics may occur, and equitable vaccine access must be a priority for MFWs. Mobile health clinics are an essential tool to achieving this goal.",COVID-19;equity;migrant farmworkers;mobile health;vaccine,pandemic
Researching the Effectiveness of an Online COVID-19 Educational Module among Community Health Nursing Students.,"The purpose of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of an innovative online COVID-19 educational module among community health nursing students. Mixed-methods study. The sample (N = 86) consisted of prelicensure and postlicensure community health nursing students, who completed a pretest, COVID-19 educational intervention, and posttest. The majority of participants' scores increased from pretest to posttest, and most participants strongly agreed that the COVID-19 educational module was effective. Strategies to address vaccine hesitancy, information learned and found most helpful, and plans for application and utilization of this knowledge were revealed. An online COVID-19 community health nursing educational intervention was effective at improving participants' knowledge, confidence, and attitudes regarding COVID-19. Online COVID-19 community health nursing education was an effective strategy for increasing preparation for this pandemic and the format can be useful to utilize for future public health emergencies.","COVID-19;community health nursing;education, distance;students",pandemic
Nurses' mental workload and public health emergency response capacity in COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study.,"The aim of this study was to assess the level of mental workload of Chinese nurses through a latent profile analysis and to explore its relationship with public health emergency response capacity. A cross-sectional design with a convenience sample. A convenience sample of nurses from five tertiary hospitals in Chengdu between May and December 2022. Demographic, work-related information, Nurse's version of NASA's Task Load Index Scale and Nurse's Public Health Emergency Response Capacity Scale were used in this study. The mean scores for mental workload and emergency response capacity for nurses were (57.19 ± 15.67) and (3.58 ± 0.77) respectively. We found that the mental workload of nurses fell into three potential categories. In addition, there were differences in psychological training and supply of epidemic prevention materials in the department among nurses with different mental workload subtypes. There was a moderate negative correlation between nurses' mental workload and public health emergency response capacity. Our results show that there is still a strong mental workload on a proportion of nurses, and enhanced psychological training and material supply support are beneficial in relieving nurses' mental workload. The better the nurses' capacity to cope with public health emergencies, the lower their mental workload. Nursing managers should pay ongoing attention to the mental workload status of nurses in the latter stages of a pandemic and individual differences in nurses' mental workload. In addition, nursing managers should be aware of the impact of public health emergency response capacity on nurses' mental workload. They can intervene in nurses mental workload from a new perspective. 560 registered nurses participated in this study.",emergency care;latent class analysis;mental health;nurse;professional competence;public health nursing,pandemic
Were public interventions relevant for containing the covid-19 pandemic in Brazil in 2020?,"Flattening the curve was the most promoted public health strategy worldwide, during the pandemic, to slow down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and, consequently, to avoid overloading the healthcare systems. In Brazil, a relative success of public policies was evidenced. However, the association between public policies and the ""flatten the curve"" objectives remain unclear, as well as the association of different policies to reach this aim. This study aims to verify if the adoption of different public policies was associated with the flattening of the infection and death curves by covid-19 first wave in 2020. Data from the Sistema de Informação da Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe (Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System - SIVEP-Gripe) and the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE) were used to compute standardized incidence and mortality rates. The Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) was used to obtain information about governmental responses related to the mitigation of pandemic effects, and the Human Development Index (HDI) was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. A non-linear least-square method was used to estimate parameters of the five-parameter sigmoidal curve, obtaining the time to reach the peak and the incremental rate of the curves. Additionally, ordinary least-square linear models were used to assess the correlation between the curves and the public policies adopted. Out of 51 municipalities, 261,326 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stringency Index was associated with reducing covid-19 incremental incidence and death rates,in addition to delaying the time to reach the peak of both pandemic curves. Considering both parameters, economic support policies did not affect the incidence nor the mortality rate curves. The evidence highlighted the importance and effectiveness of social distancing policies during the first year of the pandemic in Brazil, flattening the curves of mortality and incidence rates. Other policies, such as those focused on economic support, were not effective in flattening the curves but met humanitarian and social outcomes.",D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D001938:Brazil;D000086402:SARS-CoV-2;D011640:Public Policy,pandemic

Physical and psychological repercussions on Nursing workers' health in COVID-19 units: A mixed-methods research study.,"to analyze how Nursing workers in COVID-19 hospital units perceive the physical and psychological repercussions of work on their health, as well as to identify the factors associated with their perceptions. a parallel-convergent mixedmethods study conducted with 359 Nursing workers from COVID-19 units in seven hospitals. For the collection of quantitative data, a questionnaire containing sociodemographic and labor variables and related to perceptions of physical and psychological repercussions were used, and for qualitative data, semi-structured interviews were used. For the analysis, inferential statistics and thematic content analysis were used. daytime workers, who had more than one employment contract and worked more than 41 hours/week perceived more moderate/intense physical repercussions, reporting overload and time off deficits. Nurses and CLT workers perceived psychological repercussions more moderately/intensely, mentioning managerial overload and job dissatisfaction. Women were 97% more likely to perceive physical repercussions and three times more likely to perceive psychological repercussions when compared to men, reporting household and family overloads. work and family overloads, intensified by the pandemic context, were associated with the intensity with which Nursing workers perceived physical and psychological repercussions.",D008297:Male;D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D000086382:COVID-19;D009740:Nursing Staff;D004651:Employment;D058873:Pandemics;D007588:Job Satisfaction,pandemic
"Triple Burden: The Incorrigible Threat of Tuberculosis, HIV, and COVID-19.","The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) hasn't seen the dawn since its emergence, however waxing and waning has resulted in the emergence of deadly variants. The effects of the pandemic have not been limited to its virulence, but have rather conferred multiple collateral effects, especially in developing countries; thereby, designating it as a SYNDEMIC. The same culminated in neglect of non-COVID-19 conditions like tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Besides being the prognostic factor for severe COVID-19, these infections in hidden pockets served as a reservoir for the emergence of the deadly Omicron. Another significant impact of this juxtaposition was on the delivery of healthcare services for TB and HIV. The unanticipated COVID-19 pandemic turned the path of ongoing progress of elimination programs. Direct consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic were pronounced on diagnosis, treatment, and services for patients with TB and HIV. Essential TB services were reallocated to the COVID-19 rapid response task force. However, despite escalating the tribulations, this triple burden has simultaneously taught lessons to escalate the progress of halted programs. The pandemic has catalyzed an unusual level of collaboration among scientists, which can be exploited for TB and HIV. Fast-track diagnostics, digitalization, contact tracing, and vaccine development have enabled the world to envision the same for TB/HIV.",COVID-19;DOTS;HIV/AIDS;management;pandemic;tuberculosis,pandemic
Virtual Schooling and Pediatric Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"In this single-site, retrospective, descriptive chart review and survey, we investigated changes in pediatric behavioral health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationship between virtual schooling and hospitalized children's mental health. Subjects included patients aged 6 and 18 years during the 2015 to 2019 and 2020 to 2021 school years who received inpatient mental health care. Parents of patients admitted in 2020 to 2021 were surveyed regarding their child's schooling. We additionally described and compared subjects using descriptive data, including proxies for illness severity, and assessed how these outcomes changed during the pandemic and correlated with school modality. During the pandemic, the distribution of diagnoses changed, and some markers of severity increased. Patients in exclusively virtual school had higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders and tic disorders, and lower rates of eating and disruptive behavior disorders, than patients with recent in-person school. Further study is needed regarding the impact of virtual schooling on pediatric mental health.",COVID-19;adolescent medicine;education;pediatric hospital medicine;pediatric mental health;pediatric psychiatry;pediatric psychology,pandemic
Asthma exacerbations in the pediatric emergency area: Evaluation and prospects for improvement of pre-hospital care.,"The frequency of visits to emergency department for asthma is a significant public health problem in pediatrics. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of children who visited the pediatric emergency department for asthma exacerbation and evaluated their therapeutic management prior to admission. A prospective study was conducted over a 6-month period in the pediatric emergency departments of five hospitals involving children aged 1-16 years admitted to the department with a clinical diagnosis of asthma exacerbation. In all, 143 patients were enrolled in the study. Asthma episodes were moderate to severe in 69.2% of cases (n = 99). Initial treatment prior to admission to the emergency department was adequate in only 17.5% of cases (n = 25). Hospitalization for more than 24 h occurred in 18.2% (n = 26) patients. In children aged <3 years, viral infection was present in 91.4% cases (n = 64) and exacerbations were more severe in younger patients (P = 0.002) and children belonging to low-income stratum (P = 0.025). Only 17.4% (n = 25) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (antigen test or polymerase chain reaction test), suggesting that the involvement of traditional respiratory viruses in asthma exacerbation continued even during pandemic. Regarding the pre-hospital care, 70.6% (n = 101) had received prior treatment, but this treatment was inadequate in 53.1% cases (n = 76). This study showed that asthmatic children and their families had little knowledge about the disease and that physicians must be sufficiently aware of current recommendations for managing asthmatic children. Admission to the emergency department for asthma could be avoided partially by better diagnosis and therapeutic education.","D002648:Child;D006801:Humans;D011446:Prospective Studies;D001249:Asthma;D006760:Hospitalization;D004636:Emergency Service, Hospital;D006761:Hospitals",pandemic
Using an integrated social cognition model to identify the determinants of QR code check-in compliance behaviors in the COVID-19 pandemic.,"In Australia, checking in while entering venues was a legal requirement during the COVID-19 pandemic to track potential infection sites. This two-wave correlational study used an integrated theory of planned behavior model including moral norms, anticipated regret, and habit to predict check-in compliance in a sample of 181 Victorians (Mean Age = 41.88, 56.4% female) and 162 Queenslanders (Mean Age = 43.26, 47.5% female). Habit and intention predicted behavior, while perceived behavioral control did not. Intention was predicted by baseline habit, attitude, subjective norm, and moral norm in the Victorian sample, while only baseline habit and moral norm predicted intention in the Queensland sample. This study has potential implications for reviewing previous strategies and for future pandemic preparedness, both by identifying the drivers of infection control compliance, and through the discussion of how differences in effects between states may be linked to each state's experience of the pandemic (e.g. infection rates, lockdown length).",QR code check-in;health behavior;social cognition theory;theory of planned behavior,pandemic
Is nurses' clinical competence associated with their moral identity and injury?,"The enhancement of nursing care quality is closely related to the clinical competence of nurses, making it a crucial component within health systems. The present study investigated the relationship between nurses' clinical competence, moral identity, and moral injury during the COVID-19 outbreak. This cross-sectional study was carried out among frontline nurses, using the Moral Identity Questionnaire (MIQ), the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP), and the Competency Inventory for Registered Nurse (CIRN) as data collection tools. and research context: The research population for this study consisted of all frontline nurses (n = 251) employed in a hospital in southern Iran. Sampling was conducted between May 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021, during the COVID-19 outbreak. The present study received approval from the research ethics committee of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, with project No. 99267 and code of ethics ID No. IR. RUMS.REC.1399.262, dated 15.02.2021. According to the study findings, 42.2% of the nurses demonstrated high clinical competence, while 51.4% exhibited moderate clinical competence. The results indicated a positive correlation between moral identity and clinical competence but a negative correlation between moral injury and clinical competence. Furthermore, the variables of moral identity and moral injury were found to predict 10% of the variance in clinical competence. According to the results, moral identity and moral injury had an impact on the clinical competence of nurses. Therefore, implementing a program aimed at enhancing moral identity and providing training strategies to address moral injury during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to improvements in nurses' clinical competence and the overall quality of care they provide.",COVID-19;Nurse;clinical competence;moral identity;moral injury,pandemic
Infections associated with SARS-CoV-2 exploited via nanoformulated photodynamic therapy.,"The pandemic of COVID-19 has highlighted the need for managing infectious diseases, which spreads by airborne transmission leading to serious health, social, and economic issues. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a 60-140 nm diameter and particle-like features, which majorly accounts for this disease. Expanding diagnostic capabilities, developing safe vaccinations with long-lasting immunity, and formulating effective medications are the strategies to be investigated. For the literature search, electronic databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were used as the source. Search terms like 'Nano-mediated PDT,' 'PDT for SARS-CoV-2', and 'Nanotechnology in treatment for SARS-CoV-2' were used. Out of 275 initially selected articles, 198 were chosen after the abstract screening. During the full-text screening, 80 papers were excluded, and 18 were eliminated during data extraction. Preference was given to articles published from 2018 onwards, but a few older references were cited for their valuable information. Synthetic nanoparticles (NPs) have a close structural resemblance to viruses and interact greatly with their proteins due to their similarities in the configurations. NPs had previously been reported to be effective against a variety of viruses. In this way, with nanoparticles, photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be a viable alternative to antibiotics in fighting against microbial infections. The protocol of PDT includes the activation of photosensitizers using specific light to destroy microorganisms in the presence of oxygen, treating several respiratory diseases. The use of PDT in treating COVID-19 requires intensive investigations, which has been reviewed in this manuscript, including a computational approach to formulating effective photosensitizers.",COVID-19;PDT;drug delivery;photosensitizers;vaccines,pandemic
Liposomes: from August Wassermann to vaccines against COVID-19.,"The development of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a big challenge for many countries in 2020-2022. mRNA vaccines were shown to be effective and safe and have been widely used worldwide in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The fundamental factor in creating mRNA vaccines, which ensures effective delivery of mRNA to the host cells, is the composition of lipid nanoparticles, namely the presence of ionized charged lipids, which ensures the binding of mRNA molecules. However, the significant role of liposomes in the development of liposomal vaccines and identification of immunochemical reactions involving lipids should be assessed in the context of the development of the pioneering idea of August Wassermann about the use of liposomal antigens in the diagnosis and immunoprophylaxis of serious human diseases. The review is devoted to the use of liposomal antigens as antigen-delivery systems for diagnosis and immunoprophylaxis. Studies of cardiolipin antigen in serodiagnosis of syphilis became the foundation of antibodies in diagnosing various infectious diseases and pathological conditions, such as tuberculosis, lupus erythematosus, COVID-19, borreliosis, etc. Identification of antiphospholipid antibodies (mainly anticardiolipin) and today is the most important diagnostic tool for antiphospholipid syndrome. The liposomal system first proposed in 1906 for the diagnosis of syphilis evolved more than a century later into mRNA vaccines, which are used today in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",Wassermann reaction;antilipid antibodies;cardiolipin antigen;lipid nanoparticle;liposomal antigen delivery system;mRNA vaccine;serodiagnosis of syphilis,pandemic
C-MEMS-derived glassy carbon electrochemical biosensors for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.,"According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the world has experienced more than 766 million cases of positive SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 6.9 million deaths due to COVID through May 2023. The WHO declared a pandemic due to the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, and the fight against this pandemic is not over yet. Important reasons for virus spread include the lack of detection kits, appropriate detection techniques, delay in detection, asymptomatic cases and failure in mass screening. In the last 3 years, several researchers and medical companies have introduced successful test kits to detect the infection of symptomatic patients in real time, which was necessary to monitor the spread. However, it is also important to have information on asymptomatic cases, which can be obtained by antibody testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this work, we developed a simple, advantageous immobilization procedure for rapidly detecting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Carbon-MEMS-derived glassy carbon (GC) is used as the sensor electrode, and the detection is based on covalently linking the SARS-CoV-2 antibody to the GC surface. Glutaraldehyde was used as a cross-linker between the antibody and glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The binding was investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization and cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to measure the change in total impedance before and after incubation of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody with various concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The developed sensor can sense 1 fg/ml to 1 µg/ml SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This detection is label-free, and the chances of false positives are minimal. The calculated LOD was ~31 copies of viral RNA/mL. The coefficient of variation (CV) number is calculated from EIS data at 100 Hz, which is found to be 0.398%. The developed sensor may be used for mass screening because it is cost-effective.

Burnout in healthcare - the Emperor's New Clothes.,"Burnout is common among physicians; it severely alters their health and has a negative impact on functioning of healthcare systems. Hypertension, increased cortisol levels, maladaptive behaviors with negative social consequences, and suboptimal quality of care have been associated with healthcare providers' burnout. As the number of patients with cancers, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders will rise, we need new solutions to maintain physicians' health and, therefore, quality of care. Coping strategies before the COVID-19 pandemic seem ineffective in scaling all the deficits of the global healthcare systems. Examples of new initiatives include new collaborative projects, such as COH-FIT (The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times - https://www.coh-fit.com), which aims to collect global data and understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health in order to identify various coping strategies for patients and healthcare workers during infection times, or MEMO (Minimizing Error, Maximizing Outcome), funded by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Others: i) Rome Foundation GastroPsych undertake efforts dedicated to the science and practice of psychogastroenterology, a burgeoning field with roots in behavioral intervention, cognitive science and experimental psychology focused on fostering the professional growth and collaboration of those engaged in medical practices, or ii) World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO), Train The Trainers (TTT) program including a new topic of the impact of burnout on career longevity in order to foster strategies for staying healthy and increasing career satisfaction. There is a need for continuous development of digital technologies (e.g. training simulators, telemedicine, robots and artificial intelligence). Their implementation into medical practice is inevitable. Now more than ever, there is a need for a new spirit in healthcare. Together with others in the field, we believe this article is a desperate call for maximizing the use of novel technologies supported by collaborative interactions among healthcare providers and medical professionals of diverse medical fields.",COH-FIT;TTT;WGO;artificial intelligence;burnout;healthcare;medicine;mental health;psychiatry;stress,pandemic
Psychological characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel disease during the first wave of COVID-19.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)) are chronic, immune-mediated diseases with unclear aetiology, characterized by relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. These conditions significantly impair patients' physical and mental condition and quality of life. To investigate the impact of the current pandemic situation on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients' psychological status and to determine factors that mediate the level of depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. This was a multicentre, observational, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study. A total of 206 participants (male: 34%) were involved. The online survey consisted of 8 different psychological measures (such as depression, anxiety, coronavirus distress, health-related quality of life, etc.) and other therapy-specific and sociodemographic factors. 28.2% of respondents showed depressive symptoms and 11.2% indicated moderate to severe anxiety. Also, 27.7% revealed mild, moderate, or severe distress regarding the coronavirus situation. According to regression analysis, anxiety and coronavirus distress are mostly influenced by psychological factors. In contrast, the changes in quality of life and depression can be explained by disease-specific and psychological factors as well. Patients need more attention during this period to help them cope with psychological factors and prevent their IBD from becoming worse.",COVID-19;anxiety;depression;inflammatory bowel diseases;quality of life,pandemic
Evaluation of the effects of the pandemic period on cirrhosis patients.,"Cirrhosis is a common liver disease, which is characterized by life-limiting complications. In cirrhosis, liver ACE2 mRNA levels were 34-times upregulated, ACE2 protein 97-times upregulated, and ACE2 receptors increased in 80% of hepatocytes. Increased ACE2 receptor sensitizes hepatocytes to COVID-19. To evaluate the applications of cirrhosis patients to the Emergency Department before and after the pandemic. The study was conducted retrospectively in a single centre on cirrhotic patients who applied to the Emergency Department in a 2-year period. The obtained data were compared with the laboratory values of the patients: the severity of cirrhosis, the reasons for applying to the Emergency Department, hospitalization/discharge status, and pre-pandemic and pandemic period values. The mortality of the patients was recorded. The biochemical values, CTP score, and complications of cirrhosis patients deteriorated during the pandemic period, which contributed to the increase in mortality and that the CTP score and its complications worsened, which contributed to the increase in mortality. COVID-19 positivity contributes to the progression of the CTP score, but it is not directly associated with mortality. We think that new treatment protocols should be included in the guidelines to minimize the effects of this type of viral infection on the liver.",COVID-19;Child Turcotte Pugh;cirrhosis;liver damage,pandemic
Implementation of California COVIDNet - a multi-sector collaboration for statewide SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represented a formidable scientific and technological challenge to public health due to its rapid spread and evolution. To meet these challenges and to characterize the virus over time, the State of California established the California SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Initiative, or ""California COVIDNet"". This initiative constituted an unprecedented multi-sector collaborative effort to achieve large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 across California to monitor the spread of variants within the state, to detect new and emerging variants, and to characterize outbreaks in congregate, workplace, and other settings. California COVIDNet consists of 50 laboratory partners that include public health laboratories, private clinical diagnostic laboratories, and academic sequencing facilities as well as expert advisors, scientists, consultants, and contractors. Data management, sample sourcing and processing, and computational infrastructure were major challenges that had to be resolved in the midst of the pandemic chaos in order to conduct SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance. Data management, storage, and analytics needs were addressed with both conventional database applications and newer cloud-based data solutions, which also fulfilled computational requirements. Representative and randomly selected samples were sourced from state-sponsored community testing sites. Since March of 2021, California COVIDNet partners have contributed more than 450,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from remnant samples from both molecular and antigen tests. Combined with genomes from CDC-contracted WGS labs, there are currently nearly 800,000 genomes from all 61 local health jurisdictions (LHJs) in California in the COVIDNet sequence database. More than 5% of all reported positive tests in the state have been sequenced, with similar rates of sequencing across 5 major geographic regions in the state. Implementation of California COVIDNet revealed challenges and limitations in the public health system. These were overcome by engaging in novel partnerships that established a successful genomic surveillance program which provided valuable data to inform the COVID-19 public health response in California. Significantly, California COVIDNet has provided a foundational data framework and computational infrastructure needed to respond to future public health crises.",D006801:Humans;D000086402:SARS-CoV-2;D000086382:COVID-19;D023281:Genomics;D002140:California;D000079803:Data Management,pandemic
"Loneliness Trajectories, Associated Factors and Subsequent Health in Children and Young People During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Matched Cohort Study.","Loneliness is common amongst children and young people (CYP) and is an independent risk factor for poor health. This study aimed to i) determine whether subgroups of CYP with different loneliness trajectories (during the second year of the pandemic) exist; ii) examine associations with socio-demographic characteristics and subsequent health; and iii) understand whether associations between loneliness and subsequent health were modified by SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 5851 CYP (N=3260 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 2591 SARS-CoV-2 negative) provided data on loneliness (via the validated 3-item version of the UCLA Loneliness Scale for Children) at least twice in a 12-month period post PCR index-testing (conducted October 2020-March 2021). Latent class growth analyses were used to identify distinct classes of loneliness trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify socio-demographic characteristics associated with class membership. Logistic regression models assessed the odds of reporting impairing symptoms 12-months post index-test. Four distinct loneliness trajectories were identified: three mostly stable (low, medium, high) and one low-increasing trajectory. Being older, female, living in more deprived areas and testing negative were associated with greater odds of being in the highest vs lowest loneliness trajectory; eg OR for female vs male: 5.6 (95% CI:4.1,7.8); OR for 15-17 vs 11-14 years: 4.5 (95% CI:3.4,6.0). Following higher loneliness trajectories was associated with higher odds of experiencing impairing symptoms 12-months post index-test: ORadjusted (compared to lowest loneliness trajectory) were 15.9 (95% CI:11.9,21.3) (high loneliness), 6.5 (5.3,7.9) (medium loneliness) and 2.3 (1.9,2.8) (low-increasing loneliness). There was no evidence that this association was modified by PCR index-test result. About 5.3% of CYP were classified into a group experiencing (chronically) high loneliness. Being female, older and from more deprived areas were risk factors of belonging to this group. Results suggest that even small increases from low loneliness levels may be associated with worse health outcomes.",Adolescence;Loneliness;Longitudinal Studies;Mental Health;Pandemic;Physical Health,pandemic
When a pandemic and epidemic collide: Lessons learned about how system barriers can interrupt implementation of addiction research.,"Telehealth technologies are now featured more prominently in addiction treatment services than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but system barriers should be carefully considered for the successful implementation of innovative remote solutions for medication management and recovery coaching support for people with opioid use disorder (OUD). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded a telehealth trial prior to the COVID-19 pandemic with a multi-institution team who attempted to implement an innovative protocol during the height of the pandemic in 2020 in Tampa, Florida. The study evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile device application, called MySafeRx, which integrated remote motivational recovery coaching with daily supervised dosing from secure pill dispensers via videoconference, on medication adherence during buprenorphine treatment. This paper provides a participant case example followed by a reflective evaluation of how the pandemic amplified both an existing research-to-practice gap and clinical system barriers during the implementation of telehealth clinical research intervention for patients with OUD. Implementation challenges arose from academic institutional requirements, boundaries and role identity, clinical staff burnout and lack of buy-in, rigid clinical protocols, and limited clinical resources, which hampered recruitment and intervention engagement. As the urgency for feasible and effective telehealth solutions continues to rise in response to the growing numbers of opioid-related deaths, the scientific community may use these lessons learned to re-envision the relationship between intervention implementation and the role of clinical research toward mitigating the opioid overdose epidemic.",addiction treatment;implementation;opioid use disorder;system barriers;telehealth,pandemic
"Telepractice implementation experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, a qualitative exploration of Australian disability allied health providers: A diamond in the rough.","Telepractice has existed for decades, but as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it gained value and increased desirability across the disability service and health sectors, as a mitigation strategy for the viral transmission risk. The increased desirability of telepractice encouraged organisations to invest and correspondingly enhance access to services delivered remotely via digital technology including allied health therapy interventions. The investment and uptake of telepractice provided greater learning opportunities and ability to investigate telepractice implementation in specific contexts such as disability services, enabling service providers the ability to tailor to specific population needs. This study investigated the experience of telepractice implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic from 13 allied health clinicians and managers of disability organisations across Australia between November 2021 and February 2022. A contextualist and critical realist theory was applied through the study, with reflective thematic analysis used as the data analysis method and findings described using a metaphor method centring on diamond formation. The method selection aimed to produce findings grounded in qualitative methodology and methods while remaining accessible to the disability community. An exploration and analysis of the data by the authors identified six themes addressing the experiences of participants and used the metaphor of diamond formation to describe changes in allied health clinicians and disability organisations during the COVID-19 influenced telepractice implementation. The allied health clinicians and managers who participated in this study demonstrated an overall sense of hope that telepractice would be a viable and sustainable delivery pathway for services in the future. This article endorses the integration of a planned telepractice delivery pathway that capitalises on the momentum created by the COVID-19 pandemic in a purposeful and accessible way that looks to enhance rather than replace current practices.",Australia;COVID-19;Telemedicine;allied health;disability;disabled persons;implementation;telehealth;telepractice,pandemic
"Awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skills regarding telemedicine among Syrian healthcare providers: A cross-sectional study.","After the widespread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) around the globe, it was imperative to establish preventative measures to restrict the virus's transmission. The purpose of this research was to present an overview of the awareness, knowledge, attitude, and abilities of Syrian physicians about telemedicine technology. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from April 1 to May 15, 2022. The questionnaire was taken from published study, and the inclusion criteria consist the Syrian doctors who worked in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly those who had direct contact with patients. Among 385 responses, 52.72% of them were females, 83.9% of them were aged less than 30 years old, and 66% were working in the governmental sector; 66% of participants have moderate knowledge about using computers and the internet, 80% have heard about telemedicine. Despite that, 95.1% of participants have not attended any training workshop on telemedicine, and most of them have reported no availability of a telemedicine unit in their department. Only 31.7% participants have shown high awareness of telemedicine. Furthermore, no significant correlation was identified between the academic level with the age and telemedicine awareness, knowledge, attitude, or computer skills. Despite that, there was an obvious correlation between age and computer skills (P-value < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the medical specialty and awareness, and computer abilities, especially the anesthesiology (88.5 ± 5.2), (84 ± 8.7), respectively. Spearman's rho test showed mild positive significant association in various subscales (awareness and experience, experience and skills, knowledge and attitude, knowledge and skills, and attitude and skills). The study results demonstrate that most of the participating clinical doctors have a neutral view of telemedicine, even though they do not know much about it and do not have considerable experience with it.

From March to June 2021, we conducted an electronic questionnaire survey of 267 RPL women who attended the recurrent pregnancy loss clinic at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS-C) were used to screen for anxiety, depression, stress, and social support. Logistic regression was used to explore the related factors of anxiety and depression. RPL women had severe psychological problems during the pandemic: 56.6% showed state anxiety or trait anxiety, 26.6% showed high levels of stress, and 13.1% showed depression. Economic pressure caused by COVID-19, and high stress were common related factors for anxiety and depression. The interval since last miscarriage <6 months, worse mood changes due to COVID-19, and concerns about COVID-19 were associated with anxiety. A history of pregnancy loss >14 weeks was associated with depression. While adequate social support and actively seeking health help were protective factors for trait anxiety. And identifying the etiology was a protective factor for depression. The study revealed the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and the associated factors in RPL women during COVID-19.

Barriers and facilitators experienced in delivering alcohol screening and brief interventions in community pharmacy: a qualitative evidence synthesis.,"Following increases in deaths due to alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been renewed calls to increase resources in alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI). Research has shown that community pharmacy could be a promising setting for SBI. This review aimed to investigate the barriers and facilitators to SBI delivery in community pharmacy to inform its further development. A systematic search of four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) was conducted in October 2021 to identify relevant published qualitative or mixed-method studies. Relevant qualitative data were extracted from the included studies and a framework synthesis was performed using the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model. Two thousand two hundred and ten articles were screened and nine studies were included in the review (seven in the United Kingdom and two in Australia). Identified barriers and facilitators to delivering SBI corresponded to all components of the COM-B model. Facilitators included non-confrontational communication skills, aligning SBI with existing pharmacy services and pharmacist role legitimacy. Barriers included multiple demands on staff time, a lack of staff experience with screening tools, and staff concerns of causing offence. Using the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), we propose five elements of a pharmacy SBI to address identified barriers. Research into SBI in community pharmacy is limited in comparison to other healthcare settings and this review provides an understanding of the barriers and facilitators to the delivery of SBI in community pharmacy from a behavioural perspective.

We advance this work by using the diffusion of innovations theory (DOI) to consider constellations of behaviors as innovation packages: multiple innovations that are logically related, interdependent in their use or effects, and often promoted as a set (Rogers, 2003). In addition, we embraced DOI's focus on behavioral decisions as a continual process that can include adoption and discontinuance over time, especially as new innovations (e.g., COVID-19 vaccine) appear. To that end, we conducted a latent transition analysis of COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (N = 697; 97% received a COVID-19 vaccine) across three time points in the pandemic: initial outbreak; a secondary, record-breaking rise in cases; and after the CDC recommended that fully vaccinated adults could discontinue wearing masks. This analysis allowed us to identify latent classes based on shared behavioral patterns and transitions between classes over time. The results showed evidence of three possible packages: (a) a package of traditional, symptom-management behaviors (covering coughs and sneezes, staying home if ill, and seeking medical care), (b) a package of just-novel COVID-19 behaviors (wearing masks, keeping six feet apart, and avoiding mass gatherings), and (c) a package of all COVID-19 mitigation behaviors. Movement between classes exemplified adoption and discontinuance of different packages, as well as widespread discontinuance with the replacement innovation: COVID-19 vaccines. Additional analyses showed that increases in hope were associated with sustained and delayed adoption; decreases in social approval were associated with discontinuance. Future directions in theorizing around innovation packages are discussed.",,pandemic
Humoral immunity to phlebovirus infection.,"Phleboviruses are zoonotic pathogens found in parts of Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America and cause disease symptoms ranging from self-limiting febrile illness to severe disease, including hemorrhagic diathesis, encephalitis, and ocular pathologies. There are currently no approved preventative vaccines against phlebovirus infection or antivirals for the treatment of the disease. Here, we discuss the roles of neutralizing antibodies in phlebovirus infection, the antigenic targets present on the mature polyproteins Gn and Gc, progress in vaccine development, and the prospects of identifying conserved neutralizing epitopes across multiple phleboviruses. Further research in this area will pave the way for the rational design of pan-phlebovirus vaccines that will protect against both known phleboviruses but also newly emerging phleboviruses that may have pandemic potential.",neutralizing antibody;neutralizing epitope;phenuiviridae;phlebovirus;vaccine;zoonosis,pandemic
Multiple Arterial Thrombosis after COVID-19: A Case Report.,"Since the beginning of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic, many reports have pointed to states of incrieased hypercoagulability during the acute phase of the disease. We report a 63-year-old female who developed acute mesenteric ischemia due to celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery thrombi together with acute lower extremity ischemia caused by saddle embolism of the iliac bifurcation and thrombosis of the left external iliac artery. These thrombi developed 20 days after discharge from an intensive care unit due to severe pneumonia and pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19. The patient had consecutive interventions. Surgical thrombectomy for aortoiliac thrombosis was performed and the mesenteric thrombosis was treated by percutaneous endovascular intervention. We emphasize that the prothrombotic state after COVID-19 infection may persist long after the acute symptomatic phase.",COVID-19;Mesenteric ischemia;Pulmonary embolism;Thromboembolism,pandemic
The safety of BCG revaccination in the context of COVID-19.,"The bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is administered in many countries as part of their vaccination schedules. Epidemiologic studies have suggested a possible benefit of this vaccine in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and other respiratory infections. We aimed to assess the safety of this intervention in BCG-primed adults. Adult health care workers (n = 451) received a single intradermal application of the BCG vaccine (Tokyo 172 strain) in the deltoid region of the right arm. Follow-up (30 days) calls and clinical inspections were guided using a standardized data sheet to assess local and systemic reactions. Early local reactions were common at 24 h and 7 days, such as erythema (74.9%, 69.2%), induration (55.7%, 59%), a papule (53.4%, 47.7%), and edema (48.3%, 38.1). Local symptoms (pruritus 44.8%, heat 16.2%, and pain 34.8%) were less frequent at day 7. Late expected reactions (14 and 30 days) included the formation of crusts (39.6% and 63.9%), a pustule (36.6% and 17%), or ulcers (28.8% and 17.7%). Severe reactions were limited to subcutaneous abscesses (2%) and lymphadenitis (<1%).","D000328:Adult;D006801:Humans;D007117:Immunization, Secondary;D000086382:COVID-19;D001500:BCG Vaccine;D058873:Pandemics;D005076:Exanthema",pandemic
The American Society for Clinical Pathology 2022 Vacancy Survey of medical laboratories in the United States.,"To determine the extent and distribution of laboratory workforce shortages within the nation's medical laboratories. The Vacancy Survey was conducted through collaboration between the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Institute for Science, Technology and Public Policy in Washington, DC, and the Evaluation, Measurement, and Assessment Department and ASCP Board of Certification in Chicago, IL. Data were collected through an internet survey distributed to individuals who were able to report on staffing and certifications for their laboratories. Results of the ASCP 2022 Vacancy Survey show increased overall vacancy rates for laboratory positions in all departments compared with 2020. Overall retirement rates for laboratory professionals increased across most departments. Current Vacancy Survey data show continued increases in the numbers of laboratory vacancies and retirements as well as changes in certification requirements, with trends amplified during the pandemic continuing into the present. Qualitative analysis results showed that there is an urgent need to focus not only on recruitment but-equally important-on retention of laboratory professionals.",ASCP Vacancy Survey;COVID-19;anatomic pathology;certification;clinical pathology;laboratory departments;laboratory staff recruitment and retention;laboratory staffing;laboratory workforce,pandemic
"Specialists accessing specialty advice: Evaluating utilization, benefits, and impact of care of an e-consultation service.","The usual referral pathway is from a primary care provider (PCP) to a specialist; however, specialists also refer to and consult with other specialists. Electronic consultation (eConsult) allows clinicians to submit questions on behalf of patients to specialists to receive timely advice. Most eConsult studies in the past have examined questions asked from PCPs to specialists. This study investigates the utilization of specialists submitting clinical questions to other specialists through the Ontario eConsult Service and identifies use-case scenarios where specialist-to-specialist eConsult may be beneficial. A retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional analysis of eConsults submitted by specialists through the Ontario eConsult Service for 24 months (March 2019 to February 2021). Utilization data is collected automatically by the service, including specialty referred to, time billed, region, and results from a closeout survey which includes the referral outcome of the eConsult and the utility to the submitting clinician. 4% (n = 3285) of all eConsults sent within the study period were specialist-to-specialist, with the others being sent by a PCP. The number of specialist-to-specialist eConsults grew 120% following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The top three specialties that submitted eConsults were pediatrics, internal medicine, and endocrinology. The top three specialties that specialists submitted to were dermatology, neurology, and hematology. A face-to-face referral was avoided in 69% of referrals. Evaluating the utilization patterns of specialist-to-specialist eConsults allows us to better understand and expand the scope of eConsult services, which have traditionally been thought of as a workflow between a PCP and a specialist.",Remote consultation;electronic consultation;specialist consultation;telehealth‌,pandemic
Silver Lining Study: Missileer Fatigue Mitigation During 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.,"The U.S. Air Force's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force stands ready to launch weapons 365 days per year. Since its inception, missileers vigilantly operate launch consoles on a 3-day cycle: minimum 24-hour alert-shift/24-hour travel-admin/24-hour off, leading to concerns that health, morale, and alertness are chronically impacted. In 2020, a Missileer Occupational Health Assessment (OHA) revealed 76% of respondents struggle with being rested for duty and 29% of respondents never feel adequately rested for duty. Later that year, 20th Air Force initiated long-duration operations to safeguard from the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic, resulting in increased operations tempo, and exacerbating crew fatigue.341st Operations Group and 341st Medical Group at Malmstrom Air Force Base enacted interventions to mitigate crew fatigue and support continued readiness during pandemic operations. They recorded, analyzed, and compiled findings in this report, including recommendations for long-term ICBM operations at Missile Wings. All participants were Nuclear and Missile Operations Officers, or missileers, were continuously evaluated with qualitative and quantitative measures to ensure safety of the force during a period of unprecedented change. Interventions implemented and evaluated during the 9-month period included: environmental modifications, scheduling changes, and crew education on fatigue management, nutrition, anticipatory sleep preparation, and fitness. Most notably, the 341st Operations Group examined various 3-person and 4-person shift-length and alert duration schedules. Psychomotor vigilance testing results validated safety of operators and delta between pre- and post-shift measurements. Crew force readiness trends were analyzed for force-health awareness. Pre- and post-OHA results were compared for subjective changes. Fatigue and health-related outcomes were collected from a safety monitoring effort during standard and COVID-19 operations at 341st Missile Wing. Findings from qualitative and quantitative data indicate the optimal schedule is a 3-week cycle:7-day alert/7-day recovery/7-day training-administrative utilizing 4-member or 3-member crews for low tempo operations. Crews experimented with shift-lengths of 24hrs-on/24hrs-off, 16hrs-on/8hrs-off, and 12hrs-on/12hrs-off. Maximum safe alert duration is 7 days due to task fatigue onset between 8 and 10 days. Short and long duration Duties Not to Include Flight (DNIF) (also known as Duties Not to Include Alert (DNIA) among missileers) rates decreased from the first to last month of the period by 74.6% and 79.2%, respectively. The number of alerts missed per month decreased 86% from baseline. The 2021 OHA found a 7% decline in members seeking separation, and absence of sleep, fatigue, and physical or mental health as missileer concerns. This analysis has identified a sustainable alert rotation of 7/7/7 with emphasis on protected recovery and training time and has been continued after concluding pandemic operations, creating consistent schedule stability where there once was none. If executed properly, this alert rotation, regardless of shift-length selected, has potential to improve trust between crews and leadership, provides adequate recovery time between alerts to maintain health, and improves wellness, family stability, morale, unit cohesion, and crew force retention. Notably, all Air Force Global Strike Missile Operations Groups adjusted scheduling practices to align with these findings.",,pandemic
Non-medical practitioners in the staffing of emergency departments and urgent treatment centres in England: a mixed qualitative methods study of policy implementation.,"Patient demand, internationally, on emergency departments and urgent care treatment centres has grown. Shortages of staff, particularly of emergency medicine doctors, have compounded problems. Some countries are pursuing solutions of including non-medical practitioners e.g., nurse practitioners and physician associates/assistants in their emergency department workforces. This study investigated at the macro and meso level of the health system in England: what the rationale was and the factors influencing the current and future employment, or otherwise, of non-medical practitioners in emergency departments and urgent treatment centres. Mixed qualitative methods in the interpretative tradition were employed. We undertook, in 2021-2022, a documentary analysis of national, regional and subregional policy (2017-2021), followed by semi-structured interviews of a purposive sample (n = 18) of stakeholders from national, regional and subregional levels. The data were thematically analysed and then synthesised. There was general national policy support for increasing the presence of non-medical practitioners as part of the solution to shortages of emergency medicine doctors. However, evidence of policy support dissipated at regional and subregional levels. There were no published numbers for non-medical practitioners in emergency departments, but stakeholders suggested they were relatively small in number, unevenly distributed and faced uncertain growth. While the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath were said to have made senior decision makers more receptive to workforce innovation, many factors contributed to the uncertain growth. These factors included: limited evidence on the relative advantage of including non-medical practitioners; variation in the models of service being pursued to address patient demand on emergency departments and the place of non-medical practitioners within them; the lack of a national workforce plan with clear directives; and the variation in training for non-medical practitioner roles, combined with the lack of regulation of that level of practice. We identified many features of a system ready to introduce non-medical practitioners in emergency departments and urgent treatment centres but there were uncertainties and the potential for conflict with other professional groups. One area of uncertainty was evidence of relative advantage in including non-medical practitioners in staffing. This requires urgent attention to inform decision making for short- and long-term workforce planning. Further investigation is required to consider whether these findings are generalisable to other specialties, and to similar health systems in other countries.","D006801:Humans;D058873:Pandemics;D004636:Emergency Service, Hospital;D000078329:Workforce;D004635:Emergency Medicine;D057766:Policy",pandemic
"Top-level leaders and implementation strategies to support organizational diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) interventions: a qualitative study of top-level DEIB leaders in healthcare organizations.","The Black Lives Matter movement and COVID-19 pandemic motivated the wide-scale adoption of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) initiatives within healthcare organizations and the creation of DEIB top-level leader positions. The next step is to understand how these leaders contribute to the implementation of DEIB interventions, a task with notable salience due to not only the historical difficulties associated with DEIB strategy execution, but also the substantial evidence that leadership plays a significant role in implementation processes. Therefore, the objective of this qualitative study is to understand the role of top-level DEIB leaders in the implementation of healthcare organizational DEIB interventions. A qualitative research approach which used an in-depth semi-structured interview approach was employed. We conducted thirty-one 60-90-min semi-structured interviews with DEIB top-level leaders between February 2022 and October 2022 over Zoom. An iterative coding process was used to identify the key implementation strategies and activities of DEIB top-level leaders. Interviewees were mostly Black, majority female, and mostly heterosexual and had a variety of educational backgrounds. We identified the DEIB top-level leader as the DEIB strategy implementation champion. These leaders drive five DEIB implementation strategies: (1) People, (2) Health Equity, (3) Monitoring and Feedback, (4) Operational Planning and Communication, and (5) External Partners. Within these, we identified 19 significant activities that describe the unique implementation strategies supported by the DEIB top-level leaders. To move toward sustained commitment to DEIB, the organization must focus on not only establishing DEIB interventions, but on their successful implementation. Our findings help explicate the implementation activities that drive the DEIB initiatives of healthcare organizations and the role of DEIB leaders. Our work can help healthcare organizations systematically identify how to support the success of DEIB organizational interventions.","D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D000092783:Diversity, Equity, Inclusion;D058873:Pandemics;D036301:Qualitative Research;D003695:Delivery of Health Care;D007857:Leadership",pandemic
24-Hour movement behaviours research during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic scoping review.,"Many studies examining 24-hour movement behaviours based on the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines (24HMG) have been published during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, no comprehensive reviews summarized and synthesized the evidence concerning studies using 24HMG. The aim of this scoping review was to synthesize the evidence from the 24HMG studies published during the pandemic. Three electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, EBSCO) were utilized to conduct a literature search. The search procedure adhered to the guidelines set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Initially, a total of 1339 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals were screened. After eliminating 461 duplicates, 878 articles remained. The titles and/or abstracts of these articles were then cross-checked, and 25 articles were included. Subsequently, two authors independently assessed full-text of articles based on the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in the final selection of 16 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Study characteristics (e.g., study population, study design, measurement) were extracted and then summarized. According to the Viable Integrative Research in Time-use Research (VIRTUE) epidemiology, the included studies were further classified into different but interrelated study domains (e.g., composition, determinants, health outcomes). The majority of included articles focused on children and adolescents as study population. This study primarily demonstrated that a low prevalence of meeting the 24HMG among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a decline in the percentage of individuals meeting the 24HMG compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. The majority of included studies focused on sociodemographic factors when examining the correlates of meeting the 24HMG, while a few studies assessed factors of other domains, such as social, cultural, and environmental aspects. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on healthy 24-hour movement behaviours in children and adolescents. In conjunction with the studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, more studies were encouraged to explore the correlates of meeting the 24HMG and the associated health benefits in wider ranges of populations.",D002648:Child;D000293:Adolescent;D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D009068:Movement;D057185:Sedentary Behavior,pandemic
Self-rated health impact of COVID 19 confinement on inmates in Southeastern of Europe: a qualitative study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the implementation of various measures within closed institutions like prisons to control the spread of the virus. Analyzing the impact of these measures on the health of inmates is crucial from a public health perspective. This study aimed to explore inmates' subjective perception of the COVID-19 lockdown, the implemented measures, their physical self-perception, and their views on the vaccination process. Between April 2021 and January 2022, 27 semi-structured individual interviews and 1 focus group were conducted with inmates in a prison located in northwest Spain. The interviews were conducted in person and audio-recorded. Thematic content analysis was employed, utilizing methodological triangulation to enhance the coherence and rigor of the results. The analysis revealed two main themes and nine subthemes. The first theme focused on inmates' perception of the implementation of protective measures against COVID-19 within the prison and its impact on their well-being. The second theme explored the pandemic's emotional impact on inmates. All participants reported negative consequences on their health resulting from the measures implemented by the institution to contain the pandemic. However, they acknowledged that measures like lockdowns and mass vaccination helped mitigate the spread of the virus within the prison, contrary to initial expectations. COVID-19 and related measures have directly affected the health of inmates. To improve their health and minimize the impact of pandemic-induced changes, community participation and empowerment of individuals are essential tools, particularly within closed institutions such as prisons.",D006801:Humans;D011329:Prisoners;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D003140:Communicable Disease Control;D011330:Prisons;D005060:Europe,pandemic
The district operation centres in one of the largest local health authorities in Italy to manage COVID-19 surveillance and homecare: first implementation and results of a survey addressed to general practitioners.,"COVID-19 pandemic represented a shock for healthcare systems. Italy was one of the first country to deal with a huge number of patients to be diagnosed, isolated, and treated with scarce evidence-based guidelines and resources. Several organizational and structural changes were needed to face the pandemic at local level. The article aims at studying the perceived impact of the newly implemented District Operation Centres (DOCs) of Local Health Authority (LHA) Roma 1 in managing active surveillance and home care of COVID-19 patients and their close contacts in cooperation with general practitioners (GPs). A questionnaire, developed according to Delphi methodology, was validated by 7 experts and administered to a randomized sample of GPs and family paediatricians (FPs). All medical doctors selected received a phone interview between December 2020 and January 2021. The questionnaire investigated general characteristics of the sample, relations with DOC and its usefulness, and potential developments. A descriptive analysis was performed and inferential statistical tests were used to assess differences. In April 2020 the LHA Roma 1 implemented one DOCs in each local health district. 215 medical doctors were interviewed, reaching the sample target for health districts (80% CL and 10% MOE) and the whole LHA (90% CL and 5% MOE). Several aspects in the management of COVID-19 cases and close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and of the support of DOCs to GPs/FPs were investigated. More than 55% of the GPs and FPs interviewed found the DOCs useful and more than 78% would recommend a service DOC-like to other LHAs. The medical professionals interviewed would use DOCs in the future as support in treating vulnerable patients, utilizing digital health tools, enlisting specialist doctors, establishing networks, and facilitating professional counselling by nurses. This study is an attempt to evaluate an organizational change happened during COVID-19 pandemic. DOCs were created to support GPs and FPs as a link between primary healthcare and public health. Although several difficulties were disclosed, DOCs' experience can help to overcome the fragmentation of the systems and the duality between primary care and public health and make the system more resilient.",D006801:Humans;D058005:General Practitioners;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D011795:Surveys and Questionnaires;D006699:Home Care Services,pandemic
"Work stressors, work-family conflict, parents' depressive symptoms and perceived parental concern for their children's mental health during COVID-19 in Canada: a cross-sectional analysis.","Work-related stressors and work-family conflict are important social determinants of mental health. While the impact of these stressors on parents' mental health is well documented, we know comparatively less about their impact on children's mental health. Furthermore, though the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered these stressors, particularly with the increase in teleworking, major knowledge gaps persist regarding the association between parents' stressors and perceived parental concern for their children's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the stress contagion perspective, this study tests (1) the mediating role of parents' depressive symptoms with parental concern for their children's mental health, and (2) whether these associations vary depending on whether parents had the opportunity to engage in telework. A path analysis was performed from a cross-sectional analytic sample of 780 employed parents in the province of Quebec (Canada). The same model was then stratified by teleworking opportunity. The model's indirect associations were obtained by the bootstrap bias-corrected method with 1,000 replications. The results show that the stressors of work-to-family conflict, increased difficulties in work-family balance since the COVID-19 pandemic, irregular schedules, low esteem derived from work, and job insecurity were all indirectly associated with an increase in parental concern for their children's mental health through increased parents' depressive symptoms. However, some associations differ depending on teleworking status. The indirect associations involving increased difficulties in work-family balance since the COVID-19 pandemic as well as irregular work schedules were observed only in the teleworking group. This study fills a gap in research on the association between the work-family interface and parental concern for their children's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the importance of concerted and cohesive action between child health policies and those regarding work and work-family balance to prevent work-related psychosocial risks, particularly considering the post pandemic expanded and persistent reliance on teleworking.",D002648:Child;D006801:Humans;D008603:Mental Health;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D054541:Family Conflict;D003863:Depression;D058873:Pandemics;D000086382:COVID-19;D010290:Parents,pandemic
Introduction and acceptability of the Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Côte d'Ivoire.,"The Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) has been implemented for various infectious diseases since 2015. 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, SORMAS was adapted to SARS-CoV2. We assessed the acceptability and usability of SORMAS and accompanied its implementation in two pilot regions of Côte d'Ivoire (Abidjan 2 and Gbêkê) from July/August 2021 to March 2022. We conducted 136 semi-structured interviews to cover knowledge on COVID-19, information on conventional surveillance systems for disease monitoring including COVID-19, acceptability of SORMAS, and impact of SORMAS on epidemic preparedness and surveillance. Scores before and 6-8 months after implementation were compared. SORMAS was implemented in two pilot regions in Côte d'Ivoire. The conventional software for the surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic by the company MAGPI was maintained in parallel; the additional time needs to enter and manage the data in SORMAS were the main concern. SORMAS acceptance and satisfaction scores were high after the user training, which was prior to implementation, and after 6-8 months of use. The ability of SORMAS to improve COVID-19 preparedness and early detection of cases and contacts was widely acknowledged. To keep the understanding and skills of users up-to-date, regular refresher trainings were requested. The expectation to be able to make decisions based on data produced by SORMAS was high at baseline and the perceived experience after several months of use of the software was very positive. Unfortunately, the link with the laboratories could not be established in the pilot regions, but it is an existing feature of SORMAS that many users were asking for. Following the positive experience using SORMAS for COVID-19, the pilot regions expanded its use for monitoring and management of measles, yellow fever, meningitis, and cholera. SORMAS was very well accepted by users and decision makers in the two pilot regions of Côte d'Ivoire and its ability to improve epidemic preparedness and surveillance was acknowledged. If the hurdles of maintenance (tablets, server, and maintaining user skills) are handled sustainably, it can serve as a valid tool to identify, surveil and manage future outbreaks of various infectious diseases in Côte d'Ivoire.","D006801:Humans;D007560:Cote d'Ivoire;D058873:Pandemics;D012367:RNA, Viral;D000086382:COVID-19;D000086402:SARS-CoV-2;D003141:Communicable Diseases;D004196:Disease Outbreaks",pandemic
The effect of smartphone addiction on the relationship between psychological stress reaction and bedtime procrastination in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Previous studies on bedtime procrastination mainly focused on the influencing factors of stress and draw less attention on the role of family environment. This study aimed to explore the effect of psychological stress reaction on bedtime procrastination in young adults, with considering the mediating effect of smartphone addiction, and the moderating effect of family cohesion during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 1217 young adults completed psychological stress reaction scale, Smartphone addiction tendency scale for young adults, bedtime procrastination scale and family cohesion scale. A moderated mediation model was conducted to clarify the effect of psychological stress reaction on bad bedtime procrastination in young adults. The findings showed that: (1) The individual level of psychological stress reaction was positively associated with bedtime procrastination; (2) Smartphone addiction mediated the effect of psychological stress reaction on bedtime procrastination; (3) Family cohesion moderated the relationship among psychological stress reaction, smartphone addiction and bedtime procrastination. This study revealed the effect of smartphone addiction on the relationship between psychological stress reaction and bedtime procrastination during the COVID-19 pandemic, and these findings could provide novel evidence that family cohesion may serve as a protective factor against the negative consequences of smartphone addiction on bad bedtime procrastination.","D006801:Humans;D055815:Young Adult;D000075682:Procrastination;D000082424:Internet Addiction Disorder;D058873:Pandemics;D000086382:COVID-19;D013315:Stress, Psychological;D000068997:Smartphone",pandemic
"Research on transportation management model of COVID-19 medical waste: a case study in Beijing, China.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable masks, protective clothing, gloves, and nasopharyngeal swabs collected by nucleic acid testing formed a large amount of medical waste. Medical waste has strict temporary storage time requirements in hospitals, which need to be transported to medical waste disposal plants within the specified time. However, as most of disposal plants are far away from downtown, they also need to be responsible for the transportation and disposal of medical waste in many hospitals, and put forward higher requirement for transportation routes. Rapid and safe disposal of all types of medical waste generated by COVID-19 is crucial to the prevention and control of the epidemic. This paper designs the transportation route optimization model using Anylogic simulation software based on the regional distribution of 118 tertiary hospitals and 2 large medical waste disposal plants in Beijing, China. At the same time, transportation routes of 118 tertiary hospitals in the morning peak, evening peak, all-day, and ordinary periods were simulated based on the Beijing traffic index in 2017. On this basis, through the analysis of the simulation data, the selection of medical waste transport routes for 118 tertiary hospitals in the morning peak, evening peak, all day, and ordinary periods is further clarified, so as to ensure that medical waste can be transported to the medical waste disposal plant in the shortest time. The shortest path and fastest speed transport mode, medical waste transport data set, and the selection of transport mode of 118 tertiary hospitals formed by this research provide certain reference experience for the rapid and safe transport of medical waste during the epidemic period, and also provides corresponding data support for medical waste transportation management in the post-epidemic era and medical waste transportation decision-making when facing major public health problems.",Fastest speed;Medical waste;Shortest path;Tertiary hospital;Transportation,pandemic
Evaluation of falls in older persons in the emergency department during the early Coronavirus-2019 pandemic and pre-pandemic periods.,"This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics, outcomes and healthcare costs of older patients presented to the emergency department (ED) with falls in the periods before and during the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hospital records one year before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were retrospectively analyzed through ""International Statistical Classification of Diseases-10th Revision"" codes. Age, gender, falls, triage classification, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and the ED, COVID-19 status, Glasgow Coma scale, consultations-comorbidities, injury status, outcomes in the ED, and costs were recorded. The study comprised of 3187 patients aged ≥ 65 years admitted to the ED of a university hospital between March 2019 and 2021. In terms of pre-pandemic and pandemic periods; older patients presenting with falls to the ED, consultations, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and LOS in the ED were lower in the pandemic period, but costs were higher (p = 0.03, p = 0.01, p = 0.01, p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). Hospitalization/mortality rates were higher in COVID-19 positive patients (77.2%) than in COVID-19 negative patients (4.6%) within the pandemic period and the patients in the pre-pandemic period (22.8%), and the costs, as well (both p = 0.01). Though the number of fall-related presentations of older persons to the ED, comorbidity burden, consultations, and the LOS in the ED was lower, direct costs were higher during the pandemic period, particularly for COVID-19 positive older patients admitted to ED with falls than the pre-pandemic period, and those patients were with poorer outcomes.",Accidental;Aged;COVID-19 virus;Emergency department;Falls;Pandemics;SARS-CoV-2,pandemic

In this backdrop, this work proposes a deep learning approach to turn a smartphone-the popular hand-held personal gadget-into a diagnostic tool to measure/monitor the three most important body vitals, i.e., pulse rate (PR), blood oxygen saturation level (aka SpO2), and respiratory rate (RR). Furthermore, we propose another method that could extract a single-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) of the subject. The proposed methods include the following core steps: subject records a small video of his/her fingertip by placing his/her finger on the rear camera of the smartphone, and the recorded video is pre-processed to extract the filtered and/or detrended video-photoplethysmography (vPPG) signal, which is then fed to custom-built convolutional neural networks (CNN), which eventually spit-out the vitals (PR, SpO2, and RR) as well as a single-lead ECG of the subject. To be precise, the contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) estimation of the three body vitals (PR, SpO2, RR) from the vPPG data using custom-built CNNs, vision transformer, and most importantly by CLIP model (a popular image-caption-generator model); (2) a novel discrete cosine transform+feedforward neural network-based method that translates the recorded video-PPG signal to a single-lead ECG signal. The significance of this work is twofold: (i) it allows rapid self-testing of body vitals (e.g., self-monitoring for covid19 symptoms), (ii) it enables rapid self-acquisition of a single-lead ECG, and thus allows early detection of atrial fibrillation (abormal heart beat or arrhythmia), which in turn could enable early intervention in response to a range of cardiovascular diseases, and could help save many precious lives. Our work could help reduce the burden on healthcare facilities and could lead to reduction in health insurance costs.",D008297:Male;D005260:Female;D006801:Humans;D000068997:Smartphone;D004562:Electrocardiography;D006339:Heart Rate;D001281:Atrial Fibrillation;D017156:Photoplethysmography;D000086382:COVID-19,pandemic
Change of urban park usage as a response to the COVID-19 global pandemic.,"Urban parks became critical for maintaining the well-being of urban residents during the COVID-19 global pandemic. To examine the impact of COVID-19 on urban park usage, we selected New York City (NYC) and used SafeGraph mobility data, which was collected from a large sample of mobile phone users, to assess the change in park visits and travel distance to a park based on 1) park type, 2) the income level of the visitor census block group (visitor CBG) and 3) that of the park census block group (park CBG). All analyses were adjusted for the impact of temperature on park visitation, and we focused primarily on visits made by NYC residents. Overall, for the eight most popular park types in NYC, visits dropped by 49.2% from 2019 to 2020. The peak reduction in visits occurred in April 2020. Visits to all park types, excluding Nature Areas, decreased from March to December 2020 as compared to 2019. Parks located in higher-income CBGs tended to have lower reductions in visits, with this pattern being primarily driven by large parks, including Flagship Parks, Community Parks and Nature Areas. All types of parks saw significant decreases in distance traveled to visit them, with the exception of the Jointly Operated Playground, Playground, and Nature Area park types. Visitors originating from lower-income CBGs traveled shorter distances to parks and had less reduction in travel distances compared to those from higher-income CBGs. Furthermore, both before and during the pandemic, people tended to travel a greater distance to parks located in high-income CBGs compared to those in low-income CBGs. Finally, multiple types of parks proved crucial destinations for NYC residents during the pandemic. This included Nature Areas to which the visits remained stable, along with Recreation Field/Courts which had relatively small decreases in visits, especially for lower-income communities. Results from this study can support future park planning by shedding light on the different uses of certain park types before and during a global crisis, when access to these facilities can help alleviate the human well-being consequences of ""lockdown"" policies.","D006801:Humans;D011998:Recreation;D000068316:Parks, Recreational;D058873:Pandemics;D011633:Public Facilities;D000086382:COVID-19",pandemic
Comprehensive antibody and cytokine profiling in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to clinical outcomes in a large Belgian cohort.,"The immune response in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly variable and is linked to disease severity and mortality. However, antibody and cytokine responses in the early disease stage and their association with disease course and outcome are still not completely understood. In this large, multi-centre cohort study, blood samples of 434 Belgian COVID-19 hospitalized patients with different disease severities (ranging from asymptomatic/mild to critically ill) from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were obtained. Baseline antibody and cytokine responses were characterized and associations with several clinical outcome parameters were determined. Anti-spike immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM levels were elevated in patients with a more severe disease course. This increased baseline antibody response however was associated with decreased odds for hospital mortality. Levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IP-10 and IL-8, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the antiviral cytokines IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ1 were increased with disease severity. Remarkably, we found significantly lower levels of IFN-λ2,3 in critically ill patients compared to patients of the moderate and severe disease category. Finally, levels of IL-8, IL-6, IP-10, IL-10, IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 at baseline were positively associated with mortality, whereas higher IFN-λ2,3 levels were negatively associated with mortality.",D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D016753:Interleukin-10;D015850:Interleukin-6;D054357:Chemokine CXCL10;D016209:Interleukin-8;D058873:Pandemics;D016638:Critical Illness;D001530:Belgium;D015331:Cohort Studies;D016207:Cytokines;D016898:Interferon-alpha;D007074:Immunoglobulin G,pandemic
Social virtual reality helps to reduce feelings of loneliness and social anxiety during the Covid-19 pandemic.,"Evidence shows that the Covid-19 pandemic caused increased loneliness, anxiety and greater social isolation due to social distancing policies. Virtual reality (VR) provides users with an easy way to become engaged in social activities without leaving the house. This study focused on adults, who were socialising in Altspace VR, a social VR platform, during the Covid-19 pandemic and it explored whether social VR could alleviate feelings of loneliness and social anxiety. A mixed-methods research design was applied. Participants (n = 74), aged 18-75, completed a questionnaire inside the social VR platform to measure levels of loneliness (UCLA 20-item scale) and social anxiety (17-item SPIN scale) in the social VR platform (online condition) and real world (offline condition). Subsequently, a focus group (n = 9) was conducted to gather insights into how and why participants were using the social VR platform. Findings from the questionnaire revealed significantly lower levels of loneliness and social anxiety when in the social VR platform. Lower levels of loneliness and social anxiety were also associated with participants who socialised with a regular group of friends. In addition, findings from the focus group suggested that being part of an online group facilitates stronger feelings of belonging. Social VR can be used as a valuable intervention to reduce feelings of loneliness and social anxiety. Future studies should continue to establish whether social VR can help to encourage group formation and provide people with enhanced social opportunities beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",D000328:Adult;D006801:Humans;D008132:Loneliness;D058873:Pandemics;D000086382:COVID-19;D001007:Anxiety;D012934:Social Isolation;D000076142:Virtual Reality,pandemic
Global impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on sexual and reproductive health services: An international comparative study on primary care from the INTRePID Consortium.,"To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted sexual and reproductive health (SRH) visits. An ecological study comparing SRH services volume in different countries before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven countries from the INTernational ConsoRtium of Primary Care BIg Data Researchers (INTRePID) across four continents. Over 3.8 million SRH visits to primary care physicians in Australia, China, Canada, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and the USA. Difference in average SRH monthly visits before and during the pandemic, with negative binomial regression modelling to compare predicted and observed number of visits during the pandemic for SRH visits. Monthly number of visits to primary care physicians from 2018 to 2021. During the pandemic, the average volume of monthly SRH visits increased in Canada (15.6%, 99% CI 8.1-23.0%) where virtual care was pronounced. China, Singapore, Sweden and the USA experienced a decline (-56.5%, 99% CI -74.5 to -38.5%; -22.7%, 99% CI -38.8 to -6.5%; -19.4%, 99% CI -28.3 to -10.6%; and -22.7%, 99% CI -38.8 to -6.5%, respectively); while Australia and Norway showed insignificant changes (6.5%, 99% CI -0.7 to -13.8% and 1.7%, 99% CI -6.4 to -9.8%). The countries that maintained (Australia, Norway) or surpassed (Canada) pre-pandemic visit rates had the greatest use of virtual care. In-person SRH visits to primary care decreased during the pandemic. Virtual care seemed to counterbalance that decline. Although cervical cancer screening appeared insensitive to virtual care, strategies such as incorporating self-collected samples for HPV testing may provide a solution in a future pandemic.",COVID-19 pandemic;sexual and reproductive health,pandemic

"Enhanced recovery support for people with eating disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic: quality improvement using a web-based, stepped-care programme in Canada.","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of individuals struggling with eating disorders (EDs) increased substantially. Body Brave (a not-for-profit) created and implemented a web-based stepped-care Recovery Support Programme (RSP) to improve access to community-based ED services. This quality improvement study describes the RSP and assesses its ability to deliver timely access to treatment and platform engagement. We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing access to, and use of Body Brave services 6 months before and 12 months after implementation of the RSP platform (using 6-month increments for two postimplementation periods). Primary programme quality measures included registration requests, number of participants onboarded and time to access services; secondary measures included use of RSP action plans, attendance for recovery sessions and workshops, number of participants accessing treatment and text-based patient experience data. A substantial increase in registration requests was observed during the first postimplementation period compared with the preimplementation period (176.5 vs 85.5; p=0.028). When compared with the preimplementation period, the second postimplementation observed a significantly larger percentage of successfully onboarded participants (76.6 vs 37.9; p<0.01) and a reduction in the number of days to access services (2 days vs 31 days; p<0.01). Although participant feedback rates were low, many users found the RSP helpful, easy to access, user-friendly and were satisfied overall. Users provided suggestions for improvement (eg, a platform instructional video, offer multiple times of day for live sessions and drop-in hours). Although clinical benefit needs to be assessed, our findings demonstrate that the RSP enabled participants to quickly onboard and access initial services and have informed subsequent improvements. Understanding initial programme effects and usage will help assess the feasibility of adapting and expanding the RSP across Canada to address the urgent need for low-barrier, patient-centred ED care.",D006801:Humans;D058873:Pandemics;D058996:Quality Improvement;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D000086382:COVID-19;D001068:Feeding and Eating Disorders;D020407:Internet,pandemic
Internet-based conversational engagement randomized controlled clinical trial (I-CONECT) among socially isolated adults 75+ years old with normal cognition or MCI: topline results.,"Social isolation is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) of enhanced social interactions, hypothesizing that conversational interactions can stimulate brain functions among socially isolated older adults without dementia. We report topline results of this multi-site RCT (Internet-based conversational engagement clinical trial [I-CONECT]; NCT02871921). The experimental group received cognitively stimulating semi-structured conversations with trained interviewers via internet/webcam four times per week for six months (induction) and twice per week for an additional six months (maintenance). The experimental and control groups both received weekly 10-minute telephone check-ins. Protocol modifications were required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 186 participants were randomized. After the induction period, the experimental group had higher global cognitive test scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [primary outcome]; 1.75 points [p=0.03]. After induction, experimental group subjects with normal cognition had higher language-based executive function (semantic fluency test [secondary outcome]; 2.56 points [p=0.03]. At the end of the maintenance period, experimental group MCI subjects had higher encoding function (Craft Story immediate recall test [secondary outcome]; 2.19 points [p=0.04]. Measure of emotional well-being improved in both control and experimental groups. Resting-state functional MRI showed that the experimental group had increased connectivity within the dorsal attention network relative to the control group (p = 0.02), but the sample size was limited. Providing frequent stimulating conversational interactions via the internet could be an effective home-based dementia risk reduction strategy against social isolation and cognitive decline.",Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias;behavioral intervention;cognitive reserve;semi-structured conversations;social interactions;technology;video chats,pandemic
Time Management Strategies for Addressing Mental Health Concerns in the Pediatric Visit.,"Addressing mental health concerns within the time constraints of a busy pediatric practice can be challenging. Increasingly, pediatricians are tasked to cover even more during a routine checkup, including any sleep and dietary concerns as well as screening for mental health problems, social influencers of health, and hand-on-door queries. Since the start of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, primary care physicians have reported an increase in anxiety and depression in their pediatric patients. We present time management strategies that facilitate the clinician's ability to confront these problems together with the family. These include setting an agenda, acknowledging the limited time, using shared decision-making to prioritize topics, and offering an opportunity for further discussion at a follow-up visit. Using the mnemonic HEL2P3 can provide guidance to balance a visit with competing issues.

Emergency Free School Meal Distribution During the COVID-19 Pandemic in High-Poverty Urban Settings.,"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered nationwide school closures in March 2020, putting millions of children in the United States (US) who were reliant on subsidized school meals at risk of experiencing hunger. In response, the US Department of Agriculture mobilized the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and Seamless Summer Option (SSO) program to provide emergency free school meals. There is a need to investigate the effectiveness of these programs in covering under-resourced communities during the pandemic. This study assessed associations between meal distribution and census tract demographics (i.e., poverty level, race/ethnicity, and deprivation level based on social deprivation index [SDI] score). An observational study using longitudinal meal distribution data collected over an 18-month period following school closures (March 2020-August 2021). /setting: Monthly meal distribution data were collected for community sites serving 142 census tracts within four urban New Jersey cities predominantly populated by people with low incomes and from racial and ethnic minority groups. Main outcome measures were the number of meals served monthly by SFSP and SSO meal sites. A two-part multivariable regression approach was used to analyze the data. In the first step, logistic regression models showed that high deprivation tracts were more likely to serve meals during the observed period (OR=3.43, 95% CI 1.001-11.77, P-value=.0499). In the second step, among tracts that served any meals during the observed period, mixed effects negative binomial regression models showed that high poverty and high deprivation tracts served comparatively more meals (IRR=2.83, 95% CI 2.29-3.51, P-value<0.001 and IRR=1.94, 95% CI 1.65-2.28, P-value<0.001 respectively). Findings show that meal distribution during the pandemic was higher within census tracts with higher poverty and deprivation levels, indicating that under-resourced communities with higher need had more free meals available during this unprecedented public health emergency.",COVID-19;SFSP;SSO;food insecurity;school meals,pandemic
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from children exhibit broad neutralization and belong to adult public clonotypes.,"From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, children have exhibited different susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, reinfection, and disease compared with adults. Motivated by the established significance of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in adults, here we characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody repertoires in a young cohort of individuals aged from 5 months to 18 years old. Our results show that neutralizing antibodies in children possess similar genetic features compared to antibodies identified in adults, with multiple antibodies from children belonging to previously established public antibody clonotypes in adults. Notably, antibodies from children show potent neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants that have cumulatively resulted in resistance to virtually all approved monoclonal antibody therapeutics. Our results show that children can rely on similar SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization mechanisms compared to adults and are an underutilized source for the discovery of effective antibody therapeutics to counteract the ever-evolving pandemic.",B cells;SARS-CoV-2;antibodies;children;infection;neutralization;public clonotype;virus,pandemic
Online health information-seeking behaviour and mental well-being among Finnish higher education students during COVID-19.,"Online health information-seeking behaviour has increased since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020. This study examined whether health-related information on COVID-19 searched on the internet was associated with mental well-being among higher education students. A cross-sectional internet survey was conducted among 18- to 34-year-old students in Finland (N = 2976; mean age 24.61 years and median 24) in the spring of 2020. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric H tests, and a two-way ANOVA. The results indicated that most students (86% of females, 82% of males) used the internet to search for information on COVID-19.

COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy: ambiguity in decision-making.,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women/people were identified as an at-risk group of severe COVID-19 disease. Consequently, vaccine uptake among this group became a public health priority. However, the relationship between pregnancy and vaccination decision-making is complex, and the heightened uncertainty and anxiety produced through the pandemic further exacerbated this immunization decision. This study explores COVID-19 vaccination decision-making during pregnancy in Aotearoa New Zealand by using an online story completion survey tool. Ninety-five responses were received and analysed using thematic analysis where ambiguity was a core facet within and across stories. Three ambiguities were identified, including who makes the decision (agential), what the risks are (risk) and how immunity to this threat can be best achieved (immunity). We discuss the implications of this ambiguity and how the strong desire to protect the baby persisted across accounts. The recognition of the rather persistent ambiguity in vaccination decision-making helps conceptualize influencing factors taken into account in a more nuanced manner for further research, public health campaigns and health professionals. Future public health campaigns can consider redistributing responsibility for vaccination decision-making in pregnancy, traverse an either/or perspective of 'natural' and 'artificial' immunity-boosting and consider how risk is perceived through anecdotes and viral immediacy.","D005260:Female;D006801:Humans;D007223:Infant;D011247:Pregnancy;D000086382:COVID-19;D000086663:COVID-19 Vaccines;D058873:Pandemics;D011251:Pregnancy Complications, Infectious;D014611:Vaccination;D003657:Decision Making",pandemic
Comparative Analysis of Olfactory and Gustatory Function of Patients With COVID-19 Olfactory Dysfunction and Non-COVID-19 Postinfectious Olfactory Dysfunction.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to have a high incidence of loss of smell and taste. However, studies in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have evaluated these symptoms using subjective surveys and simple olfactory tests only. Hence, we compared the olfactory and gustatory characteristics of patient groups with COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction (C19OD) and non-COVID-19 postinfectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD) using an objective olfactory test and evaluated the significance of olfactory training in both patient groups. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 14 patients with a decreased sense of smell after having positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction results, and 56 patients with PIOD with no history of confirmed COVID-19. Participants were evaluated using the Korean version of the Sniffin' stick (KVSS) II, and chemical gustometry and olfactory training was assessed during their first visit. Olfactory training was then re-evaluated after an average of 8 (± 6) weeks. The average age of participants in the C19OD group was lower than in those in the non-COVID-19 PIOD group. The proportion of men in the C19OD group was higher than in the non-COVID-19 PIOD group. At baseline assessment, the C19OD group had better olfactory and gustatory functions. After olfactory training, the non-COVID-19 PIOD patient group showed a significant increase in all KVSS II Total, T, D, and I scores, but there was a non-significant increase in all scores in the C19OD group. The C19OD group had better olfactory and gustatory function than the non-COVID-19 PIOD group at the initial assessment. After olfactory training, there was an increase in olfactory function test scores in both groups. Olfactory training may be helpful in C19OD, as in non-COVID-19 PIOD.",D008297:Male;D006801:Humans;D012903:Smell;D000086382:COVID-19;D000857:Olfaction Disorders;D058873:Pandemics;D012189:Retrospective Studies,pandemic
"Etiology and Clinical Characteristics of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Korean Children During the Pre-COVID-19 Period, 2015-2020.","There have been many epidemiologic studies on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among children, most of which had substantial limitations. This study investigated the etiologic distribution and clinical characteristics of CAP in Korean children for 5 years before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A retrospective analysis of children hospitalized for CAP at 4 referral hospitals during 2015-2020 was performed. Cases in which bronchiolitis was suspected or pulmonary infiltration was not evident on chest radiography (CXR) were excluded. Viruses and atypical bacteria were defined as detected when positive in the polymerase chain reaction test performed for respiratory specimens. Serologic testing result for Mycoplasma pneumoniae was incorporated with strict interpretation. Pyogenic bacteria were included only when cultured in blood, pleural fluid, or bronchoalveolar lavage, but those cultured in endotracheal aspirate or sputum when the case was clinically evident bacterial pneumonia were also included. A total of 2,864 cases of suspected pneumonia were selected by diagnosis code and CXR findings. Medical chart and CXR review excluded nosocomial pneumonia and cases without evident infiltration, resulting in 517 (18.1%) CAP cases among 489 children. Regarding clinical symptoms, high fever was present in 59.4% and dyspnea in 19.9% of cases. Respiratory support was required for 29.2% of patients, including mechanical ventilation for 3.9%. Pathogens were detected in 49.9% of cases, with viruses in 32.3%, atypical bacteria in 17.8%, and pyogenic bacteria in 2.3% of cases. As single pathogens, M. pneumoniae (16.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 13.7%) were the most common. Parenteral β-lactam and macrolide antibiotics were administered in 81.6% and 50.7% of cases, respectively. A total of 12 (2.3%) cases resulted in poor outcomes, including 3 deaths. M. pneumoniae and RSV were the most commonly detected pathogens of pediatric CAP, which was selected by strict clinical and radiologic criteria. It is necessary to carefully decide whether to use parenteral antibiotics based on the epidemiology and clinical features of CAP in children.","D002648:Child;D006801:Humans;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D000086382:COVID-19;D011014:Pneumonia;D018410:Pneumonia, Bacterial;D001419:Bacteria;D009177:Mycoplasma pneumoniae;D014780:Viruses;D017714:Community-Acquired Infections;D000900:Anti-Bacterial Agents;D056910:Republic of Korea",pandemic
Mediating Role of Viral Anxiety and Insomnia in Relationship Between Work-Related Stress and Depression Among Cold Chain Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Here we investigated whether cold chain workers' insomnia, work-related stress, and viral anxiety contributed to their depression. Furthermore, we investigated the role of viral anxiety in mediating the association between work-related stress and depressive symptoms. All 200 invited cold chain workers voluntarily responded to an online survey. All were working at a market in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China, and responsible for testing nucleic acids in imported cold chain foods and disinfecting outer packaging at government request. We collected their demographic variables and rated their symptoms using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 Items (SAVE-6), Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS). Cold chain workers' depression was significantly correlated with higher SAVE-6 (r = 0.450, P < 0.01), ISI (r = 0.603, P < 0.01), MBI-GS (r = 0.481, P < 0.01), and PSS (r = 0.390, P < 0.01) scores. SAVE-6 score was significantly correlated with ISI (r = 0.462, P < 0.01), MBI-GS (r = 0.305, P < 0.01), and PSS (r = 0.268, P < 0.01) scores. Linear regression revealed that their depression was predicted by SAVE-6 (β = 0.183, P = 0.003), ISI (β = 0.409, P < 0.001), and MBI-GS (β = 0.236, P = 0.002, adjusted R² = 0.440, F = 40.04, P < 0.001) scores. Mediation analysis showed that their burnout directly influenced their depression, while viral anxiety or insomnia severity mediated the influence of burnout on depression. The study showed that burnout was a direct cause of depression and that viral anxiety and insomnia severity mediated the relationship between burnout and depression.","D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D007319:Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;D003863:Depression;D058873:Pandemics;D012034:Refrigeration;D001007:Anxiety;D002055:Burnout, Professional;D011795:Surveys and Questionnaires",pandemic

"Femicide in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil: Matched case-control study.","Amid the pandemic of violence against women, it is imperative to identify the contributing factors to lethal forms of violence against them. Femicides are the result of the intersection of variables that increase women's vulnerability. This study seeks to estimate the risk factors associated with death due to femicide in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. We considered sociodemographic variables, employment, exposure to violence, and psychoactive substance use. Our analysis employed conditional logistic regression. Using a case-control study design, we paired femicide cases with female controls from the general population, matching them by age and human development index, with a ratio of four controls per case. We analyzed 24 femicide cases and 96 controls. Women in the femicide group had lower educational attainment and were more likely to originate from outside the state of São Paulo. They predominantly held informal jobs, had experienced physical violence from intimate partners within the last 30 days, and exhibited higher alcohol, crack, and antidepressant consumption. Women in the femicide group reported more exposure to threats compared to those in the control group. Two variables significantly explained the likelihood of being a femicide case: a history of intimate partner violence in the last 30 days (OR 73.3, 95% CI: 8.1 to 661.7) and originating from outside the state of São Paulo (OR 6.5, 95% CI: 1.7 to 25.2).

Implementation of Video Blood Pressure Visits in the Veterans Health Administration.,"Almost half of veterans (44.6%) seen in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient setting are diagnosed with hypertension (HTN). Because of the widespread nature of HTN, use of virtual visits has the potential to improve blood pressure (BP) management. This evaluation assessed the effectiveness of video blood pressure visits (VBPVs) in the management of HTN in veterans enrolled in Veterans Health Administration primary care.  The program was implemented within the existing veteran-centered medical home. VBPVs are scheduled where the nurse observes veterans taking their BP and provides teaching or counseling. A national training curriculum was delivered to local nurse champions through Microsoft Teams. We analyzed improvement in BP over a 2-year period. We also captured actions taken by nurses during the VBPV by searching the electronic notes. Ratings of training and comments were summarized using feedback forms completed after training.  In total, 81,476 veterans participated in VBPVs over 2 years. Of those, 44,682 veterans had an existing ICD-10 code related to HTN. Of the 18,078 veterans who had a pre- and post-VBPV BP, the average change to systolic measurement was -10.6 mm Hg (range -82 to 78). Average change to diastolic measurement was -4.61 mm Hg (range -59 to 55). Most interventions addressed medication management (77%). Nurses' evaluations of the program were positive.  Video visits provide reliable and convenient veteran-centered care. Such visits enable care when unanticipated interruptions occur such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In addition to medication management, nurse-led interventions such as counseling on lifestyle changes can be effective in HTN management.",cardiology/cardiovascular disease;hypertension;telehealth;telemedicine;telenursing,pandemic
Involuntary social isolation and alcohol consumption: an ecological momentary assessment in Germany amid the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Alcohol consumption often occurs in a social setting, which was affected by social distancing measures amid the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, we examine how involuntary social isolation (i.e. comparing a no-lockdown stage with a lockdown stage) affects the association between loneliness, social activities, and drinking behavior. We performed an ecological momentary assessment eight times per day for 7 days amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. We recruited 280 participants and assessed their trait loneliness, daily state loneliness, social activities, and drinking behaviors. We found that a lockdown condition moderates the association between trait and daily state loneliness and alcohol consumption. During a lockdown stage, trait loneliness was positively associated, whereas state loneliness was negatively associated with alcohol consumption. During a no-lockdown stage, trait and state loneliness were both negatively associated with alcohol consumption. For both no-lockdown and lockdown stages, duration of social interaction, male gender, and weekends was positively associated with alcohol consumption. Our study suggests that an involuntary social isolation condition (i.e. a lockdown stage) changes how trait loneliness is associated with alcohol consumption.",COVID-19;alcohol use;involuntary social isolation;lockdown;quantity and quality of social interactions;trait and state loneliness,pandemic
Disparities in adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic by disability status in metropolitan Texas.,"This article addresses the urgent need for more evidence-based research using primary data to document how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the health and social wellbeing of disabled individuals. Our study sought to determine if adults with disabilities, and with specific types of disability, were more likely to suffer adverse health and social impacts related to COVID-19 than nondisabled adults in metropolitan Texas, during the first 18 months of the pandemic. We collected primary data from randomly selected residents in eight Texas metropolitan areas through a bilingual telephone survey in July 2021. Statistical analysis comprised multivariable generalized estimating equations that control for relevant sociodemographic and COVID-related risk factors, and spatial clustering. Disabled survey respondents had been more adversely affected by COVID-19 than nondisabled respondents, in terms of mental and physical health, health care access, living conditions and social life. Significant disparities were also found for almost all COVID-19 impacts when the disabled category was disaggregated by disability type. Respondents experiencing cognitive and independent living difficulties were negatively impacted in all five areas of life examined. Findings emphasize the need to consider a wide range of impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that negatively affect the health and social wellbeing of disabled persons, as well as develop disability-inclusive policies that provide adequate protections.",COVID-19;disabilities;public health,pandemic
Drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 drug therapies and antidepressants.,"Antidepressants are widely used for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety and mood disorders. Since the eruption of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the later development of targeted treatments against COVID-19, inevitably many patients receive antidepressants as well as those targeted treatments. Co-administration of antidepressant with COVID-19 therapeutics has the potential of drug-drug interactions, of varying severity and clinical significance. This is a curated narrative review of the current state of the art regarding drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 therapeutics and medications licensed for the pharmacotherapy of depression. A systematic search of electronic databases using as keywords the international nonproprietaty names of currently approved COVID-19 therapeutics and antidepressants was performed and additionally online interaction checker tools were consulted. Derived data were synthesized for each COVID-19 therapeutic and presented with up-to-date guidance. Several COVID-19 therapeutics have potential for drug-drug interactions with antidepressants. Remdesivir and Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir have the higher risk, whereas several monoclonal antibodies appear safer. The most serious drug-drug interactions (serotonin syndrome and QTc prolongation) require close monitoring, however DDI toward reducing the efficacy of antidepressants may be difficult to recognize. As COVID-19 treatment protocols take precedence, psychiatrists should exert flexibility in antidepressant use and proactively monitor treatment progress.",COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2;antidepressants;anxiety;depression;drug interactions;serotonin,pandemic
Perceptions of Adults With Hearing Loss About the Communication Difficulties Generated by the COVID-19 Preventive Measures: A Qualitative Study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of preventive measures that exacerbated communication difficulties for individuals with hearing loss. This study aims to explore the perception of adults with hearing loss about the communication difficulties caused by the preventive measures and about their experiences with communication 1 year after the adoption of these preventive measures. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted via videoconference with six adults who have hearing loss from the province of Québec, Canada. Data were examined using qualitative content analysis. The study found that face masks and in-person work (i.e., in opposition to remote work) were important barriers to communication because of hindered lipreading and competing noise in many workplaces. In contrast, preventive measures that allowed visual information transmission (e.g., transparent face masks, fixed plastic partitions) were considered favorable for communication. Communication partners were perceived as playing an important role in communication success with preventive measures: Familiar communication partners improved communication, whereas those with poor attitude or strategies hindered communication. Participants found that videoconferences could provide satisfactory communication but were sometimes hindered by issues such as bad audiovisual quality or too many participants. This study identified reduced access to speech reading and lack of general awareness about hearing issues as key barriers to communication during the pandemic. The decreased communication capabilities were perceived to be most problematic at work and during health appointments, and tended to cause frustration, anxiety, self-esteem issues, and social isolation. Suggestions are outlined for current and future public health measures to better consider the experience of people with hearing loss.",,pandemic
CE: Suicide Prevention: Protecting the Future of Nurses.,"Nurse suicide is an alarming issue that remains largely underexplored and underaddressed. Moreover, rates of suicide among nurses, which are higher than those in the general population, may increase due to additional stressors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a decided lack of data regarding nurse suicide or the efficacy of evidence-based prevention programs. This article examines the state of nurse suicide and explores the latest statistics on nurse suicide rates; contributing factors to nurse suicide; and current suicide prevention programs, such as the Critical Incident Stress Management and Healer Education Assessment and Referral programs.",,pandemic
"Diabetes mellitus, energy metabolism and COVID-19.","Obesity, diabetes mellitus (mostly type 2) and COVID-19 show mutual interactions, as they are not only risk factors for both acute and chronic COVID-19 manifestations, but also because COVID-19 alters energy metabolism. Such metabolic alterations can lead to dysglycemia and long-lasting effects. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential for a further rise of the diabetes pandemic. This review outlines how pre-existing metabolic alterations spanning from excess visceral adipose tissue to hyperglycemia and overt diabetes may exacerbate COVID-19 severity. We also summarize the different effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the key organs and tissues orchestrating energy metabolism, including adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Lastly, we provide an integrative view of the metabolic derangements that occur during COVID-19. Altogether, this review shall allow for better understanding of the metabolic derangements occurring when a fire starts from a small flame, and thereby help reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",SARS-CoV-2;adipose tissue;diabetes;liver;pancreas;skeletal muscle,pandemic
Phenotyping the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters by digital pathology and machine learning.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has continued to evolve throughout the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, giving rise to multiple variants of concern (VOCs) with different biological properties. As the pandemic progresses, it will be essential to test in near real time the potential of any new emerging variant to cause severe disease. BA.1 (Omicron) was shown to be attenuated compared to the previous VOCs like Delta, but it is possible that newly emerging variants may regain a virulent phenotype. Hamsters have been proven to be an exceedingly good model for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we aimed to develop robust quantitative pipelines to assess the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in hamsters. We used various approaches including RNAseq, RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and digital pathology, including software assisted whole section imaging and downstream automatic analyses enhanced by machine learning, to develop methods to assess and quantify virus-induced pulmonary lesions in an unbiased manner. Initially, we used Delta and Omicron to develop our experimental pipelines. We then assessed the virulence of recent Omicron sub-lineages including BA.5, XBB, BQ.1.18, BA.2, BA.2.75 and EG.5.1. We show that in experimentally infected hamsters, accurate quantification of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and macrophage infiltrates represent robust markers for assessing the extent of virus-induced pulmonary pathology, and hence virus virulence. In addition, using these pipelines, we could reveal how some Omicron sub-lineages (e.g., BA.2.75 and EG.5.1) have regained virulence compared to the original BA.1. Finally, to maximise the utility of the digital pathology pipelines reported in our study, we developed an online repository containing representative whole organ histopathology sections that can be visualised at variable magnifications (https://covid-atlas.cvr.gla.ac.uk). Overall, this pipeline can provide unbiased and invaluable data for rapidly assessing newly emerging variants and their potential to cause severe disease.",,pandemic
The experience of bereaved cancer carers in rural and regional areas: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential of peer support.,"Caring for someone with cancer during end of life care can be a challenging and complex experience. Those living in rural and regional areas are less likely to have local healthcare services and may be physically isolated. Even where support services such as respite do exist, they may be less likely to be accessed due to the time burden in travelling to services. This was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the potential benefits of peer support for bereaved carers of people with cancer from rural and regional locations during the COVID-19 period. Phone interviews were conducted with bereaved cancer carers living in rural and regional areas in Victoria. Semi-structured interviews were used, and participants were asked about their experience as a carer, bereavement and the potential for peer support. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim; transcripts were coded and a thematic analysis was conducted. 12 interviews were conducted. Carers were mostly female (85%) and were on average 58 years of age (range 42-71). Interviews lasted an average of 58 minutes (range 53-91 minutes). Three themes were derived from the data; 1) Supportive care needs while caring and the impact of COVID-19; 2) Isolation during bereavement compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3) Peer support requires flexibility to meet diverse needs. Peer support has potential to assist bereaved carers of people with cancer. A co-design approach may be beneficial for developing a flexible model for supporting and linking carers together.",D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D008297:Male;D017028:Caregivers;D058873:Pandemics;D000086382:COVID-19;D013727:Terminal Care;D009369:Neoplasms,pandemic
Ventilation conditions during COVID-19 outbreaks in six California state carceral institutions.,"Residents of carceral facilities are exposed to poor ventilation conditions which leads to the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19. Indoor ventilation conditions are rarely studied within carceral settings and there remains limited capacity to develop solutions to address the impact of poor ventilation on the health of people who are incarcerated. In this study, we empirically measured ventilation rates within housing units of six adult prisons in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and compare the measured ventilation rates to recommended standards issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Findings from the empirical assessment include lower ventilation rates than the recommended ventilation standards with particularly low ventilation during winter months when heating systems were in use. Inadvertent airflows from spaces housing potentially infected individuals to shared common spaces was also observed. The methodology used for this work can be leveraged for routine ventilation monitoring, pandemic preparedness, and disaster response.","D000328:Adult;D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D016902:Air Pollution, Indoor;D014691:Ventilation;D012119:Respiration;D011330:Prisons;D004196:Disease Outbreaks;D002140:California",pandemic

Determinants of differences in RT-PCR testing rates among Southeast Asian countries during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"A positive correlation has been demonstrated between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and COVID-19 tests per 1000 people. Although frequently used as an indicator of economic performance, GDP per capita does not directly reflect income distribution inequalities and imposed health costs. In this longitudinal ecological study, we aimed to determine if, besides GDP per capita, indicators relating to governance, public health measures enforcement, and health and research investment explain differences in RT-PCR testing rates among countries in Southeast Asia (SEA) during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using open-access COVID-19 panel data, we estimated the effect of various indicators (GDP per capita, health expenditure per capita, number of researchers per one million population, corruption perceptions index, stringency index, regional authority index) on daily COVID-19 testing by performing fixed-effects negative binomial regression. After accounting for all indicators, the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, and population density, the model provided a 2019 GDP per capita coefficient of 0.0046330 (95% CI: 0.0040171, 0.0052488; p <0.001), indicating that a rise in 2019 GDP per capita by 100 international dollars is associated with a 46.33% increase in the number of daily tests performed. Additionally, all indicators were significantly associated with the daily number of RT-PCR testing on multivariable analysis. In conclusion, we identified different country-level indicators significantly associated with differences in COVID-19 testing rates among SEA countries. Due to the study's ecological design, we caution on applying our results to the individual level given potential for systematic differences between the included countries. Additional investigation is likewise needed to understand how government expenditure on healthcare may have impacted COVID-19 testing capacity during the initial stages of the pandemic.",,pandemic
Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Comprehensive Predictor Scores as Proxy for the NCLEX-RN.,"Research is needed to examine whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected nursing students' NCLEX-RN pass rate. A decline in the NCLEX-RN pass rate would be detrimental to the nursing workforce, the nursing shortage, and nursing educational programs. This quantitative comparative study analyzed the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing students' Comprehensive Predictor scores as a proxy for the NCLEX-RN. An independent t test was conducted to test for a difference in Comprehensive Predictor scores of nursing students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no statistically significant difference in Comprehensive Predictor scores before and during the pandemic. Because there was no significant change in nursing students' pass rate on the Comprehensive Predictor as a proxy for the NCLEX-RN during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of new graduate nurses entering clinical practice is expected to remain the same as pre-pandemic levels.

Perceptions of and Preferences for Telemedicine Use Since the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Survey of Patients and Physicians.,"While the use of telemedicine (TLM) increased worldwide during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the use and acceptance of TLM post the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to evaluate patients' and physicians' self-reported use, preferences, and acceptability of different types of TLM after the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among patients and physicians in Geneva, Switzerland, between September 2021 and January 2022. Patients in waiting rooms of both private and public medical centers and emergency services were invited to answer a web-based questionnaire. Physicians working in private and public settings were invited by email to answer a similar questionnaire. The questionnaires assessed participants' sociodemographics and digital literacy; self-reported use of TLM; as well as preferences and acceptability of TLM for different clinical situations. A total of 567 patients (309/567, 55% women) and 448 physicians (230/448, 51% women and 225/448, 50% in private practice) responded to the questionnaire. Patients (263/567, 46.5%) and physicians (247/448, 55.2%) generally preferred the phone over other TLM formats and considered it to be acceptable for most medical situations. Email (417/567, 73.6% and 308/448, 68.8%) was acceptable for communicating exam results, and medical certificates (327/567, 67.7% and 297/448, 66.2%) and video (302/567, 53.2% and 288/448, 64.3%) was considered acceptable for psychological support by patients and physicians, respectively. Older age was associated with lower acceptability of video for both patients and physicians (odds ratio [OR] 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.33 and OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.66) while previous use of video was positively associated with video acceptability (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.84-5.43 and OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.91-5.54). Psychiatrists and hospital physicians were more likely to consider video to be acceptable (OR 10.79, 95% CI 3.96-29.30 and OR 3.97, 95% CI 2.23-7.60). Despite the development of video, the acceptability of video remains lower than that of the phone for most health issues or patient requests. There is a need to better define for which patients and in which medical situations video can become safe and efficient.",D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D008297:Male;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D010820:Physicians;D017216:Telemedicine,pandemic
"Improving Knowledge, Engagement, and Self-Efficacy in the Creation of Healthy Home Environments for Mothers Using a Facebook Intervention (Design for Wellness): Randomized Controlled Trial.","Designing the home environment can promote well-being. Social networks provide learning opportunities to improve health. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a Facebook intervention called Design for Wellness (DWELL). The program was created to improve knowledge, engagement, and self-efficacy in the creation of healthy home environments. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the effects of the intervention program DWELL. Content was uploaded to the Facebook group and gave the participants practical solutions for how to design their home environment for wellness. The intervention addressed multiple components of health behaviors, such as healthy eating, physical activity, tobacco-free environment, hygiene, family conversations regarding wellness issues, and stress reduction. The main outcome was the participants' overall score on the DWELL index, which we developed to assess the elements of our intervention: knowledge, awareness, engagement, and self-efficacy regarding home design for wellness. The intervention was conducted in Israel and lasted 6 weeks during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary analysis included a multivariable model to assess the DWELL score at the end of the study while controlling for baseline characteristics. The waitlist control group did not receive an intervention between the 2 administrations of the questionnaire. In total, 643 participants began the program: 322 (50.1%) in the intervention group and 321 (49.9%) in the control group. Of the 643 participants, 476 (74%) completed the study. At the end of the study, there was a statistically significant benefit of the intervention as assessed using a one-way analysis of covariance: there was a mean difference of 8.631 (SD 1.408) points in the DWELL score in favor of the intervention group (intervention: mean 61.92, SD 14.30; control: mean 53.29, SD 16.374; P<.001). Qualitative feedback from participants in the intervention group strengthened the positive results as most of them found the group beneficial. The Facebook group was very active. Being more engaged in the group correlated with having a higher DWELL score, but this relationship was weak (r=0.37; P<.001). The mean significant difference of 26.281 (SD 19.24) points between the overall DWELL score and the overall engagement score indicated that participants who were not active in the group still followed the posts and benefited. We found no improvements in the secondary outcome regarding participants' well-being. The COVID-19 lockdown may have prevented this. DWELL was found to be a beneficial intervention for improving perceptions of the design of home environments to foster wellness. Facebook was an effective platform to deliver this intervention. DWELL may become a prototype for other health promotion interventions.

Experiences and Priorities in Youth and Family Mental Health: Protocol for an Arts-Based Priority-Setting Focus Group Study.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, eHealth services enabled providers to reach families despite widespread social distancing restrictions. However, their rapid adoption often occurred without community partners' involvement and without an understanding of how they prioritize aspects of their mental health and associated service provision, both of which promote family and community-centered health care delivery. Establishing priorities in health care is essential for developing meaningful and reliable health services. As such, there is an urgent need to understand how eHealth service users, especially families who may have historically faced oppression and systemic barriers to service access, can best benefit from them. Arts-based approaches can elicit an understanding of priorities by providing an engaging and expressive means of moving beyond readily expressible discursive language and stimulating meaningful dialogue reflective of participants' lived experiences. The purpose of this research is to determine the priorities and preferences of youth; parents or caregivers; newcomers and immigrants; and Indigenous community members regarding the use of eHealth in supporting their mental health using an innovative arts-based priority-setting method. This study uses a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative, quantitative, and arts-based research. It follows a survey used to identify key knowledge partners who are interested in improving eHealth services for mental health support in Manitoba, Canada. Knowledge partners interested in group-based priority setting will be contacted to participate. We will facilitate approximately two focus groups across each subgroup of youth, parents or caregivers, newcomers or immigrants, and Indigenous community members using an integrative, quantitatively anchored arts-based method termed the ""Circle of Importance"" to understand participants' mental health priorities and how eHealth or technology may support their mental well-being. The Circle of Importance involves placing small objects, whose meaning is determined by participants, on a visual board with concentric circles that correspond to a 5-point Likert scale of importance. Following each focus group, we will evaluate participants' and focus group facilitators' experiences of the Circle of Importance using a survey and follow-up structured in-person interviews to garner how we can improve the arts-based approach used in the focus groups. The PRIME (Partnering for Research Innovation in Mental Health through eHealth Excellence) theme received institutional ethics approval on August 23, 2023. Data collection is projected for August 2023, with follow-up focus groups occurring in early 2024 as required. Data analysis will occur immediately following data collection. Findings will directly inform a multiyear applied research agenda for PRIME aimed at improving mental health services through engaging key knowledge partners. The results may inform how arts-based methods in a priority setting can reflect aspects of experience beyond the capacities of qualitative or quantitative methods alone, and whether this approach aligns well with a positive experience of research participation.

Social Determinants of Health and Patients' Technology Acceptance of Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Pilot Survey.,"Telehealth has been widely adopted by patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many social determinants of health influence the adoption. This pilot study aimed to understand the social determinants of patients' adoption of telehealth in the context of the pandemic. A survey methodology was used to capture data from 215 participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk. The study was guided by the technology acceptance model and the social determinants of health framework. The questionnaire included technology acceptance model variables (eg, perceived usefulness [PU] and perceived ease of use [PEOU]), social determinants (eg, access to health care, socioeconomic status, education, and health literacy), and demographic information (eg, age, sex, race, and ethnicity). A series of ordinary least squares regressions were conducted to analyze the data using SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp). The results showed that social determinant factors-safe neighborhood and built environment (P=.01) and economic stability (P=.05)-are predictors of the PEOU of telehealth adoption at a statistically significant or marginally statistically significant level. Furthermore, a moderated mediation model (PROCESS model 85) was used to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on the neighborhood, built environment, and economic stability. PEOU and PU significantly positively affected users' intention to use technology for both variables. This study draws attention to 2 research frameworks that address unequal access to health technologies. It also adds empirical evidence to telehealth research on the adoption of patient technology. Finally, regarding practical implications, this study will provide government agencies, health care organizations, and health care companies with a better perspective of patients' digital health use. This will further guide them in designing better technology by considering factors such as social determinants of health.",D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D064890:Social Determinants of Health;D058873:Pandemics;D010865:Pilot Projects;D017216:Telemedicine,pandemic
Decline in Prenatal Buprenorphine/Naloxone Fills during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States.,"Pregnancy provides a critical opportunity to engage individuals with opioid use disorder in care. However, before the COVID-19 pandemic, there were multiple barriers to accessing buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy. Care disruptions during the pandemic may have further exacerbated these existing barriers. To quantify these changes, we examined trends in the number of individuals filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated an interrupted time series model using linked national pharmacy claims and medical claims data from prepandemic (May 2019 to February 2020) to the pandemic period (April 2020 to December 2020). We estimated changes in the growth rate in the monthly number of individuals filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions in the 6 months preceding a delivery claim, per 100,000 pregnancies, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified 2947 pregnant individuals filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions. Before the pandemic, there was positive growth in the monthly number of individuals filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions (4.83%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.82-5.84%). During the pandemic, this monthly growth rate declined for both individuals on commercial insurance and individuals on Medicaid (all payers: -5.53% [95% CI, -6.65% to -4.41%]; Medicaid: -7.66% [95% CI, -10.14% to -5.18%]; Commercial: -3.59% [95% CI, -5.32% to -1.87%]). The number of pregnant individuals filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions was increasing, but this growth has been lost during the pandemic.","D014481:United States;D005260:Female;D011247:Pregnancy;D006801:Humans;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D000069479:Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination;D065186:Interrupted Time Series Analysis;D008484:Medicaid",pandemic
Real-world Evidence for Impact of Opioid Agonist Therapy on Nonfatal Overdose in Patients with Opioid Use Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The primary objectives of this study were to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients who were treated with buprenorphine extended-release versus buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual tablets versus methadone in a real-world setting and to evaluate the difference in nonfatal overdose events between treatment cohorts. This study was a retrospective chart review of patients with opioid use disorder initiating opioid agonist therapy in Canada during the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020 to October 31, 2021). Three treatment cohorts were defined by the initial prescribed opioid agonist therapy regimen: buprenorphine extended-release, buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual tablets, and methadone. Baseline characteristics, as well as treatment status, overdose events, and substance use 6 months after treatment initiation were collected using a standardized form. Nine clinics provided data on 379 patient cases. The incidence rate (number of events per 100 person-years) for a self-reported nonfatal overdose was 46.8 (n = 18), 19.3 (n = 10), and 1.7 (n = 1) in the methadone, buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual tablets, and buprenorphine extended-release cohorts, respectively. The risk-adjusted difference for the proportion of patients with nonfatal overdose was 8.59% (95% confidence interval, 3.10-14.08%; P = 0.0022) for methadone versus buprenorphine extended-release and 6.51% (95% confidence interval, 1.46-11.56%; P = 0.0115) for buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual tablets versus buprenorphine extended-release.

Telehealth-delivered Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder: Patient Perspectives in the Age of COVID-19.,"The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated increases in alcohol use and ushered in virtually delivered health care, creating an opportunity to examine the impacts of telehealth on alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment. To understand these impacts, we explored perspectives on telehealth-delivered psychotherapy among individuals with AUD. This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Participants (N = 31) were patients with AUD who had received telehealth-delivered AUD psychotherapy in the last 2 years (n = 11) or had never experienced AUD psychotherapy (n = 20), recruited from two large academically-affiliated health care systems in Michigan between July and August 2020. Participants were asked about perceived barriers and facilitators to AUD psychotherapy, benefits and drawbacks of telehealth-delivered AUD psychotherapy, and changes needed to improve psychotherapy delivery. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed iteratively using thematic analysis. Participants identified factors relating to perceptions of and experience with telehealth-delivered AUD psychotherapy. Findings reflected four major themes: treatment accessibility, treatment flexibility, treatment engagement, and stigma. Perceptions about telehealth's impact on treatment accessibility varied widely and included benefits (e.g., eliminating transportation challenges) and barriers (e.g., technology costs). Treatment flexibility and treatment engagement factors included the ability to use phone and video and perceptions of receiving care via telehealth, respectively. Telehealth impacts on treatment stigma were also a key theme. Overall, perceptions of telehealth treatment for AUD varied. Participants expressed the importance of options, flexibility, and collaborating on decisions with providers to determine treatment modality. Future research should explore who benefits most from telehealth and avenues to enhance implementation.",D006801:Humans;D000437:Alcoholism;D058873:Pandemics;D000086382:COVID-19;D011613:Psychotherapy;D017216:Telemedicine,pandemic
The COVID-19 frontiers - sink or swim.,"The objective of this study is to address issues faced by doctors working in the COVID-19 units during the second phase of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic, when the country registered the highest per capita rate of new COVID-19 cases in the world. A prospective study was designed using Google online questionnaire. Inclusion criteria were doctors from medical and surgical specialties working in COVID-19 units. The Czech Medical Association was approached in obtaining permission and helping us distribute the questionnaire with an introductory message with the aims of the study via email to the chairpersons of 18 medical and surgical Czech Societies and their respective members. The online questionnaire link was active for 31 days. Completion of a questionnaire implied consent to participate. Data was collected from the completed responses and statistical analysis was done. Fifteen out of eighteen invited Societies participated in the study. Out of all the transferred or volunteering doctors at the COVID units, 47.6% were from 9 medical specialties and 52.4% from 6 surgical units. The highest transfers were seen amongst male surgeons with 21 to 35 years of work experience, whilst the youngest group of doctors made the highest contribution. There was no statistical significance between the effects of COVID-19 and gender. Despite adequate medical provisions, 42% of all doctors had issues with procedural diagnostic methods, 40% tested positive for COVID-19 and 31% reported staff reduction leading to diminished patients' admissions and compromised care. Doctors from surgical departments experienced more difficulties in working in COVID-19 units. Furthermore, on contraction of COVID-19, 114 doctors asserted a lack of support and another 26% were unaware of any services. Our survey reiterates the relationship between factors related to occupational health and safety, standards of patient care and possibility of medicolegal consequences with the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.",D006801:Humans;D008297:Male;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D011446:Prospective Studies;D010820:Physicians;D018153:Czech Republic,pandemic
"Need for Sexual, Reproductive, and Mental Health Promotion Among Diverse College Students in a COVID-19 Era.","In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced unprecedented disruptions in higher education operations. While the adverse mental health effects experienced by college students due to these changes are well documented, less is known about the impact on their sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and the reciprocal relationships between SRH and mental health among adolescents and emerging adults. This position paper reviews existing literature on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on SRH, sexual violence, unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted illness and human immunodeficiency virus rates and highlights issues specific to college-aged males, females, racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, and individuals with disabilities. The need to conceptualize SRH as an integral component of normal development, overall health, and well-being in the context of COVID-19 is discussed. The need to prioritize the design and implementation of developmentally appropriate, evidence-based SRH interventions specifically targeting college students is identified. Furthermore, an intergenerational approach to SRH that includes parents/caregivers and/or college faculty and staff (e.g., coaches, trainers) could facilitate comprehensive SRH prevention programming that enhances sexual violence prevention training programs currently mandated by many colleges. Policies and programs designed to mitigate adverse pandemic-related exacerbations in negative SRH outcomes are urgently needed and should be included in mainstream clinical psychology, not only focused on preventing unwanted outcomes but also in promoting rewarding interpersonal relationships and overall well-being. Recommendations for clinical psychologists and mental health researchers are made.",Adolescents;COVID-19;College students;Diversity;Emerging adults;Mental health;Prevention;Sexual and reproductive health;Sexual violence;Well-being,pandemic
"A global analysis of implants and replacements of pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.","At the beginning of the COVID-19 emergency, non-urgent surgical procedures had to be deferred, but also emergencies were reduced. To assess the global trend of pacemaker (PM) and implantable cardiac-defibrillator (ICD) procedures performed in Italy before, during, and after the first COVID-19 emergency, all the Italian hospital discharge records related to PM/ICD procedures performed between 2012 and 2021, sent to the National Institute of Health, were reviewed. Compared to 2019, in 2020, there was a reduction of first PM implants (52,216 to 43,962, -16%; p < 0.01), but not replacements (16,591 to 17,331, + 4%; p = 0.16). In particular, in April 2020, there was a drop of first implants (- 53,4% vs the average value of April 2018 and April 2019; p < 0.01), while the reduction of replacements was less evident (-32.6%; p = NS). In 2021, PM procedures increased to values similar to the pre-pandemic period. A reduction of ICD procedures was observed in 2020 (22,355, -7% toward 2019), mainly in April 2020 (- 46% vs April 2018/April 2019; p = 0.03). In 2021, the rate of ICD procedures increased (+ 14% toward 2020). A non-significant reduction of ""urgent"" procedures (complete atrioventricular block for PM and ventricular fibrillation for ICD), even in April 2020, was observed. In 2020, there was a reduction of first PM implants and ICDs, offset by increased activity in 2021. No decrease in PM replacements was observed, and the drop in ""urgent"" PM and ICD procedures was not statistically significant.",COVID-19 pandemic;Hospital discharge records;Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;Lockdown;Pacemaker;Replacement,pandemic
The Distinction Between Social Connectedness and Support When Examining Depressive Symptoms Among Children and Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Childhood depression is associated with significant social and functional impairment, suicide risk, and persistence throughout adulthood. Recent evidence demonstrates that social connectedness and social support may serve as protective factors against the development of depression. The current study aimed to examine the effect of change in social connectedness and social support on depressive symptoms among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hierarchical regression was performed. Results indicated that parent-reported measures of change in social connectedness were inversely associated with depressive symptom severity, and could significantly predict future depressive symptom severity. In contrast, parent-reported measures of social support (i.e., from family and friends) did not significantly predict future depressive symptom severity. The presence of a pre-COVID psychiatric and/or neurodevelopmental diagnosis and baseline depressive symptom severity were also important factors associated with future depressive symptom severity. The findings suggest that an awareness of the presence of social supports (i.e., family or friends) is not sufficient for children to feel connected, but rather the mechanisms of social relationships are crucial. As our approach to public health restrictions evolves, the risk transmission of COVID-19 should be carefully balanced with the risks associated with decreased connectedness among youth.",COVID-19;Depression;Social connectedness;Social support;Youth,pandemic
Analysis of the status and content of consultations with a Cancer Consultation and Support Centre during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Cancer Consultation and Support Centres (CCSCs) in Japan have been established at designated cancer hospitals nationwide and these centres provide information and consultation support for cancer care. The purpose of this study is to analyse the status and content of consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic using consultation record data from the Cancer Consultation Support Centre (CCSC) database from January 2020 to March 2021. First, we examined the number and percentage of cases involving and not involving COVID-19 and compared the items of the entry forms between the groups. The comparison between the two groups suggests that the traditional consultation items used before the COVID-19 pandemic did not adequately cover the consultation content during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we categorised the content of consultation records related to COVID-19. As a result, the content was consolidated into 16 categories, which were appropriately captured from five different aspects. Using the resulting categories, we were able to create a complementary consultation entry form that could be operational during the COVID epidemic and consult consultants for the support they needed.

"Political partisanship, laissez-faire attitudes, and COVID-19 behaviours and viewpoints in Canada and the United States.","In the United States, clear partisan differences in responses to COVID-19 have been shown in leadership and elite cueing at the state level as well as in perspectives and behaviours of the citizenry. This study probes differences in political values-particularly the prevalence of laissez-faire attitudes-that might explain the stronger social consensus on pandemic countermeasures seen in Canada. Data were obtained from temporally aligned waves of cross-sectional surveys of Canadian and US adults in the first year of the pandemic. Survey questions were used to construct an index of laissez-faire attitudes (LFA) which, along with demographic variables and measures of partisanship, was incorporated into regression models to predict three outcomes: practice of personal mitigation measures (e.g. mask wearing), level of worry about the pandemic, and likeliness to get a vaccine. LFA scores had a strong negative relationship to all three outcomes for Canadians and Americans, albeit with larger effects among the Americans on two outcomes. Overall differences in LFA scores between Americans and Canadians were modest (0.04 on a 0-1 scale). However, Republican Party stalwarts had considerably higher LFA scores and were proportionally more numerous than Conservative loyalists in Canada. While there were partisan differences in LFA scores within Canada, the largest gap by far was between Republicans and Democrats in the USA. Respondents from Canada's Prairie provinces had slightly higher average LFA scores but there were no significant residence effects on outcomes. Laissez-faire attitudes that may conflict with public health values and measures are much more prevalent in the USA than in Canada. This difference underpins the limited effects of political partisanship and broad consensus in the Canadian public's responses to the pandemic.",COVID-19;Canadian-American comparisons;Citizen compliance;Laissez-faire;Pandemic measures;Partisanship,pandemic
The consecutive impact of COVID-19 on thoracic surgical procedures in Japan: an analysis of data from the National Clinical Database.,"The current study was designed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general thoracic surgeries in Japan. Changes in surgeries for lung cancer and metastatic lung tumors were evaluated based on National Clinical Database data regarding cancer screening. In 2021, surgeries for primary lung cancer increased by 3.4% compared to 2020, which, given the increase from 2014 to 2019, indicates an overall 11.1% decrease. In contrast, surgeries for metastatic lung tumors in 2021 decreased by 5.8% compared to 2020, which, given the increase from 2014 to 2020, indicates an overall 9.2% decrease. Half of the primary diseases for metastatic lung tumor were cases of colorectal cancer. Low anterior resection procedures in 2020 decreased by 5.5% compared to 2019. Lung and colon cancer screening examinees in 2021 were increased compared to 2020; however, they still showed respective decreases of 11% and 9.0% compared to 2019. Surgeries for primary lung cancer still decreased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The continued stagnation of screening was responsible for this decrease. Surgeries for metastatic lung tumors decreased profoundly, and the decrease in screening for primary tumors was responsible for this reduction. Our findings emphasize the significance of maintaining cancer screening efforts, even during a pandemic.",COVID-19;Lung cancer;Lung cancer screening;Metastatic lung tumor,pandemic
Prosthetics and orthotics for persons with movement disabilities in India in the postpandemic milieu.,"The SARS-CoV-2 disease had a severe impact on global socioeconomic growth, and its harmful effects continue with virus mutation. Over the past 3 years, the pandemic has caused isolation, mental trauma, stress, financial losses, and various health complications in individuals. Recent reports have stressed the sufferings of the physically abled population. However, we should not neglect the challenges faced by the disabled population, which were more severe in many ways due to their dependency on others at various levels. The strategies implemented to contain the virus have further aggravated their sufferings and made it even worse because health care priorities were skewed toward public-centered care. As a result, it is difficult to determine the extent of care the disabled population received during the pandemic. Moreover, a single-centered study reports that amputations in India increased by 54.1% compared with those during the prepandemic era. This indicates the need for special attention to the physically disabled community, especially persons with movement disabilities. These individuals are partially dependent and have the potential to make significant contributions to the gross domestic product if included in the human resources pool. The Indian government had launched various initiatives to improve their living status. But delays in policy implementation, reduction in budget allocation, and the ongoing pandemic have derailed the efforts. For these reasons, this article emphasizes several challenges in movement disability care. In addition, it makes recommendations for improving the quality of life of persons with movement disabilities. These include collaboration, creating start-up businesses, applying state-of-the-art logistics, establishing a technological ecosystem, raising public awareness, accessing high-quality care, and using contemporary medical devices.",,pandemic
Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QACs) in Wastewater Influent and Effluent Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are used in consumer and industrial products, including disinfectants. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, disinfectant use has increased, purportedly increasing loads to wastewater treatment plants and the environment. To understand how the increased usage has affected QAC loadings to treatment plants and to determine how effectively plants remove QACs from liquid effluent that is discharged to surface and groundwaters, influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected from four treatment plants (treatment capacities < 5 MGD to > 100 MGD) for 21 months beginning in May 2020. Influent QAC concentrations were hundreds of μg/L and effluent QAC concentrations were < 1 μg/L, corresponding to an average removal of 98% from all four plants. The most prevalent QACs in influent were those used most commonly in disinfectants, specifically benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs) and short-chain dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs), and influent levels of these compounds were correlated with QAC sales. Prior to this study, ethylbenzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (EtBACs) had not been studied, and they comprised 13 ± 6% of QACs in influent. While removal was high at all plants, low μg/L concentrations were still continuously discharged into the environment. For QACs with equivalent alkyl chain lengths, those with aromatic substituents (BACs and EtBACs) appear to be removed more effectively than those with only alkyl chains (DADMACs).",COVID-19;benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs);dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DADMACs);disinfectants;wastewater treatment,pandemic
Alcohol use disorder in alcohol-associated liver disease: Two sides of the same coin.,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) has emerged as the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) worldwide, with 40% of LTs in the US performed for ALD in 2019. The ALD-related health care burden accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in young individuals. Alcohol use disorder (AUD), which focuses on the negative effects of alcohol on psychosocial, physical, and mental health, is present in the majority of ALD patients, with moderate to severe AUD in 75%-80%. During the last decade, early LT (eLT) has emerged as a life-saving treatment for selected patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH); these patients may have a higher risk of using alcohol after LT. The risk of alcohol use recurrence may be reduced during the pretransplant or posttransplant period with AUD treatment using behavioral and/or pharmacological therapies and with regular monitoring for alcohol use (self-reported and complemented with biomarkers like phosphatidylethanol). However, AUD treatment in ALD patients is challenging due to patient, clinician, and system barriers. An integrated model to provide AUD and ALD care by hepatologists and addiction experts in a co-located clinic starting from LT evaluation and selection to monitoring listed candidates and then to following up on LT recipients should be promoted. However, the integration of addiction and hepatology teams in an LT program in the real world is often present only during evaluation and candidate selection for LT. Data are emerging to show that a multidisciplinary integrated AUD treatment within an LT program reduces recurrent alcohol use after LT. If we want to continue using eLT for patients with severe AH, LT programs should focus on building integrated multidisciplinary care teams for the integrated treatment of both AUD and ALD.",,pandemic
Diagnostic stewardship and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: Lessons learned for prevention of emerging infectious diseases in acute-care settings.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the importance of stewardship of viral diagnostic tests to aid infection prevention efforts in healthcare facilities. We highlight diagnostic stewardship lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how diagnostic stewardship principles can inform management and mitigation of future emerging pathogens in acute-care settings. Diagnostic stewardship during the COVID-19 pandemic evolved as information regarding transmission (eg, routes, timing, and efficiency of transmission) became available. Diagnostic testing approaches varied depending on the availability of tests and when supplies and resources became available. Diagnostic stewardship lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic include the importance of prioritizing robust infection prevention mitigation controls above universal admission testing and considering preprocedure testing, contact tracing, and surveillance in the healthcare facility in certain scenarios. In the future, optimal diagnostic stewardship approaches should be tailored to specific pathogen virulence, transmissibility, and transmission routes, as well as disease severity, availability of effective treatments and vaccines, and timing of infectiousness relative to symptoms. This document is part of a series of papers developed by the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America on diagnostic stewardship in infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship.1.",,pandemic
Sexual satisfaction and vaccine application in health professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual satisfaction have been emphasized in many studies. However, there is not much information about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sexual satisfaction of healthcare professionals. In addition, it is not known exactly how vaccination application affects sexual satisfaction. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the sexual satisfaction of male health personnel would change with vaccination. One hundred and two unvaccinated and 95 vaccinated male healthcare professionals participated in this study. The COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) and The New Sexual Satisfaction Scale (NSSS) were administered to the participants. We did not detect any difference in sexual satisfaction according to vaccine administration. However, we found significant relationships between COVID-19 anxiety and sexual satisfaction. On the other hand, age, fear of COVID-19, and previous COVID-19 infection story were predictive factors on sexual satisfaction. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual satisfaction are multifaceted. Our findings indicate that fear of COVID-19, rather than vaccination, determines sexual satisfaction.",COVID-19;Sexual satisfaction;sexual behavior;sexual health;vaccination,pandemic
Using Online Photovoice to Explore Food Decisions of Families on Low Income: Lessons Learnt During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The method of photovoice has been previously used to effectively engage with socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and explore their eating behaviours. In this methodological article, we draw on our experiences from using photovoice through online interviews with families on low income about their food decisions. A purposive recruitment approach targeted parents of children 2-17 years old who lived on a tight budget across the island of Ireland. Participants provided demographic information and were invited to take photographs of food-related decisions and activities for 1 week during the COVID-19 lockdown. The photographs were then discussed through an online communication platform to generate qualitative data. A total of 28 parents participated in the photo-elicited interviews and shared a total of 642 photographs of factors that influenced their food decisions. Following the interviews, the researchers documented their reflections which focused on (1) participants' engagement with the online photo-elicitation and (2) practical aspects around participant consent and data safety. The participants in our study engaged well with the online photovoice method and shared a variety of photos which provided ample material to facilitate the conversations around their food environment and its impact on their food decisions. Our experiences can provide novel insights into using photovoice in a virtual environment and useful considerations around ethics and data collection for researchers who work with socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Photo-elicited interviews offer an engaging and flexible data collection technique that can highlight issues informing future priorities of healthcare policy.",families on low income;food decisions;online interviews;photovoice,pandemic
Impact of COIL: Learning From Student Nurses in Norway Who Collaborated With U.S. Students.,"The aim of this study was to describe the experience of Norwegian nursing students with internationalization through participation in a Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) course.

Literature gaps exist in post-implementation assessment data that ascertain internationalization through the COIL experience. This was a qualitative study with a descriptive design. Data were collected from focus group interviews and analyzed conventional content-analysis approaches. Fifteen Norwegian undergraduate nursing students who participated in the COIL opportunity completed focus group interviews.

[Impacto psicosocial de la COVID-19 en los profesionales de los Servicios de Vigilancia Epidemiológica de Cataluña.].,"Healthcare professionals were subjected to very demanding working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this paper was to assess the level of risk of suffering a psychosocial disorder in the professionals of the Epidemiological Surveillance Services of Catalonia (EVS) during the sixth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. An epidemiological study of prevalence was carried out in SVE workers in Catalonia. The information was collected through a questionnaire of sociodemographic and occupational data and the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) from January to March 2022. A score equal to or greater than 7 on the GHQ-28 was considered positive and indicated a risk of suffering some disorder. The dependent variables were the score and positivity of the GHQ-28 test. The relationship between the GHQ-28 score and the rest of the independent variables of the study was studied with the Odds Ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence intervals (IC). The mean age of the population studied was 37 years (SD=±11.4) and 75% were women. 53.8% of the participants presented a positive result in the GHQ-28. The participants with the highest psychosocial risk were workers with a history of psychological problems (OR 2.8; IC95% 1.2-6.7). The risk was also higher in women (OR 1.8; IC95% 0.8-4.1), participants with health professions (OR 1.2: IC95% 0.6-2.5), those who were taking pharmacological treatment (OR 2.4; IC95% 0.6-9.7) or those who were undergoing psychological therapy (OR 1.5; IC95% 0.6-3.6) at the time of data collection and workers who did not had a perception of work support and recognition from their work teams (OR 1.8; IC95% 0.9-3.8), although some differences were not statistically significant. The professionals of the SVE professionals presented, during the sixth pandemic wave, a high risk of psychosocial disorder. As measures to be adopted, and with the aim of reducing psychosocial risk among its professionals, it is recommended to introduce organizational changes in surveillance services to prevent psychosocial disorders among its professionals.",D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D000328:Adult;D008297:Male;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D013030:Spain;D006282:Health Personnel;D011795:Surveys and Questionnaires;D012189:Retrospective Studies,pandemic

Common mental health problems in medical students and junior doctors - an overview of systematic reviews.,"Common mental health problems (CMHP) are prevalent among junior doctors and medical students, and the COVID-19 pandemic has brought challenging situations with education disruptions, early graduations, and front-line work. CMHPs can have detrimental consequences on clinical safety and healthcare colleagues; thus, it is vital to assess the overall prevalence and available interventions to provide institutional-level support. This overview summarises the prevalence of CMHPs from existing published systematic reviews and informs public health prevention and early intervention practice. Four electronic databases were searched from 2012 to identify systematic reviews on the prevalence of CMHPs and/or interventions to tackle them. Thirty-six reviews were included: 25 assessing prevalence and 11 assessing interventions. Across systematic reviews, the prevalence of anxiety ranged from 7.04 to 88.30%, burnout from 7.0 to 86.0%, depression from 11.0 to 66.5%, stress from 29.6 to 49.9%, suicidal ideation from 3.0 to 53.9% and one obsessive-compulsive disorder review reported a prevalence of 3.8%. Mindfulness-based interventions were included in all reviews, with mixed findings for each CMHP. The prevalence of CMHPs is high among junior doctors and medical students, with anxiety remaining relatively stable and depression slightly increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research on mindfulness-based interventions is required for a resilient and healthy future workforce. the researchers have followed PRISMA guidance.

The persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric emergency department visits for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.,"We examined data from a large, high acuity, pediatric psychiatric emergency department (ED) to assess both the immediate and longer-term impact of the pandemic on ED visits for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among youth. Youth ages 5-17 years presenting at a pediatric psychiatric ED in New York, NY from March 2019-November 2021 were included in this study. Visits were categorized as pre-pandemic, pandemic year 1, or pandemic year 2. We examined changes in demographic and clinical characteristics among patients presenting across the three time periods, as well as multivariable associations between these characteristics and STBs. Over 32 months, 2728 patients presented at 4161 visits. The prevalence of a discharge diagnosis of STBs increased from 21.2% pre-pandemic to 26.3% (p < 0.001) during pandemic year 1, and further increased to 30.1% (p = 0.049) during pandemic year 2. Youth were 21% more likely to receive a discharge diagnosis of STBs in pandemic year 1 (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07, 1.36) and 35% more likely in pandemic year 2 (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.19, 1.52) compared to pre-pandemic baseline. In a large, high-acuity ED, STBs continued to increase 20 months after the initial COVID-19 lockdown.

Changes in sleep and the prevalence of probable insomnia in undergraduate university students over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the U-Flourish cohort study.,"Sleep problems associated with poor mental health and academic outcomes may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To describe sleep in undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This longitudinal analysis included data from 9523 students over 4 years (2018-2022), associated with different pandemic phases. Students completed a biannual survey assessing risk factors, mental health symptoms and lifestyle, using validated measures. Sleep was assessed with the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI-8). Propensity weights and multivariable log-binomial regressions were used to compare sleep in four successive first-year cohorts. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine changes in sleep over academic semesters and years. There was an overall decrease in average SCI-8 scores, indicating worsening sleep across academic years (average change -0.42 per year; P-trend < 0.001), and an increase in probable insomnia at university entry (range 18.1-29.7%; P-trend < 0.001) before and up to the peak of the pandemic. Sleep improved somewhat in autumn 2021, when restrictions loosened. Students commonly reported daytime sleep problems, including mood, energy, relationships (36-48%) and concentration, productivity, and daytime sleepiness (54-66%). There was a consistent pattern of worsening sleep over the academic year. Probable insomnia was associated with increased cannabis use and passive screen time, and reduced recreation and exercise. Sleep difficulties are common and persistent in students, were amplified by the pandemic and worsen over the academic year. Given the importance of sleep for well-being and academic success, a preventive focus on sleep hygiene, healthy lifestyle and low-intensity sleep interventions seems justified.",COVID-19 restrictions;Sleep–wake disorders;epidemiology;health promotion and early intervention;university students,pandemic
Physical Activity Level Alterations Due to the Lockdowns: A Multi-Center Greek University-Based Study.,"This cross-sectional study determines the impact of the pandemic lockdowns on physical activity, and evaluates the factors associated with physical activity cessation on students and personnel of eight Greek Higher Education Institutions. A total of 6,380 volunteer participants completed a survey reporting their physical activity levels and perceptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was made available through an online platform. Both the conduct and intensity of physical activity were significantly reduced from the pre-pandemic era to the second lockdown (P<0.001). Walking was the most frequently selected type of physical activity, in all periods except for the second lockdown. Loss of interest (52.4%) was the main, self-reported factor for cessation of physical activity. Females had a 31% lower probability of ceasing physical activity during lockdowns. The conduct and intensity of physical activity decreased significantly during the pandemic. Female gender, annual checkup attendance, and specific physical activity types during the pre-pandemic era were associated with a reduction in the risk of pausing physical activity during lockdowns.

"Exposures to Bleach, Peroxide, Disinfectants, Antimalarials, and Ivermectin Reported to the California Poison Control System Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2015-2021.","The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread fear of infection, with many people expanding their use of cleaning products and trying unproven prevention and treatment strategies. We described shifts in reported exposures related to COVID-19 home interventions. This study considered suspected toxicity exposures involving household cleaning products (bleach, peroxide, disinfectants), antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine), and ivermectin reported to the California Poison Control System from 2015 through 2021 and assessed trends in exposures by using interrupted time-series analyses. We found a significant increase in exposures reported to the California Poison Control System related to household cleaning products and ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of January 1, 2015, the baseline level of reported exposures to household cleaning products was 707.33 per month and was declining at a rate of 1.71 (95% CI, -2.87 to -0.56) per month through February 29, 2020. In March 2020, an increase of 466.57 (95% CI, 328.08-605.07) reported exposures above baseline occurred, after which exposures to cleaning products decreased at a rate of 23.40 (95% CI, -32.48 to -14.32) per month. The number of reported exposures to antimalarials did not change significantly before or during the pandemic. The number of reported ivermectin exposures before December 2020 was initially stable at 14.50 per month and then increased by 2.05 per month through December 2021. Our observations suggest that while some dangerous home prevention and treatment efforts resolve over time, further interventions may be needed to reduce the public health effects related to attempts to self-treat COVID-19 with ivermectin.",COVID-19;antimalarials;bleach;chloroquine;disinfectants;household cleaning products;hydroxychloroquine;ivermectin;peroxide,pandemic
Virtual nourishment: Paediatric feeding disorder management with telepractice amidst COVID-19: An allied health perspective.,"The rapid adoption of telepractice services by health professionals was necessary to maintain service continuity for children with paediatric feeding disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, during periods where in-person therapy was restricted. The aim of this study was to explore clinical perspectives and reflections on the use of telepractice for managing paediatric feeding disorders during the pandemic. A post-positivist qualitative approach using thematic analysis was adopted. This study seeks to understand participants' experiences and thoughts from allied health professionals from speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and dietetics working with paediatric feeding in Western Australia. All participants delivered at least 10 telepractice sessions to children from birth to 12 years with a paediatric feeding disorder. Braun and Clarke's six-step thematic analysis process was used to analyse the data inductively. Eleven allied health professionals representing eight clinical settings in Western Australia, including speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and dietetics, working with paediatric feeding were recruited. The results revealed four themes: families becoming the catalyst of change, clinician comfort over confidence, insights into authentic mealtimes, and the paradox of choice. This study highlighted the need to build clinicians' confidence and competence, and the provision of service guidelines and training. Although many clinicians had positive experiences with telepractice, most returned to in-person delivery once COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, emphasising the importance of comfort in service delivery selection. We recognise that the findings of this study are constrained by the fact that it was conducted in a single geographical region and utilised a small qualitative sample. While telepractice was successful in managing paediatric feeding disorders, further development and implementation of telepractice guidelines are needed for telepractice to be a viable service delivery option for families and children with feeding disorders.",COVID-19;allied health;multidisciplinary;paediatric feeding disorder;swallowing;telehealth,pandemic
GET-UP Trial 1-year results: long-term impact of an early mobilization protocol on functional performance after surgery for chronic subdural hematoma.,"Evidence on timing for mobilization after chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) surgery is heterogeneous, and practices differ considerably among neurosurgical centers. The Impact of an Early Out-of-Bed Paradigm in Postoperative Outcomes of Chronic Subdural Hematomas: GET-UP Randomized Prospective Trial (GET-UP Trial) is a randomized clinical trial comparing a postoperative early mobilization protocol to bed rest. Previously reported results at clinical discharge and 1 month after surgery indicated a decreased risk of medical complications in the early mobilization group. Herein, the authors report outcomes at the 1-year follow-up. The GET-UP Trial is a prospective, randomized, unicentric, open-label study with an intention-to-treat primary analysis designed to evaluate the impact of an early mobilization protocol after burr hole craniostomy for cSDH on the occurrence of medical complications and functional outcomes. Between January 2019 and August 2021, a total of 208 patients were recruited and randomized to either an early mobilization group, in which patients began elevation of the head of the bed within the first 12 hours after surgery, or to a bed rest group, in which patients remained recumbent for 48 hours. Outcomes assessed at the 1-year follow-up included functional status as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) and repeat surgery for hematoma recurrence (surgical recurrence). A total of 203 patients completed 1 year of follow-up: 101 in the bed rest group and 102 in the early mobilization group. No significant baseline pre-randomization clinical differences were observed between the two management groups. At 1 year after surgery, a favorable functional outcome, defined as a GOSE score ≥ 5, was observed in 59 patients (58.4%) in the bed rest group and 78 (76.5%) in the early mobilization group (p = 0.006). Death occurred in 25 patients (24.8%) in the bed rest group and 16 (15.7%) in the early mobilization group (p = 0.108). Surgical recurrence was noted in 6 patients (5.9%) in the bed rest group and 7 (6.9%) in the early mobilization group (p = 0.788). Multivariate analysis showed an independent association between early mobilization and an increase in favorable functional outcomes (OR 2.006, 95% CI 1.076-3.739, p = 0.028). The GET-UP Trial is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the impact of mobilization strategies on medical complications after burr hole craniostomy for cSDH. Regarding functional results 1 year after surgery, early mobilization was associated with an improvement in functional outcomes without an increase in surgical recurrence. These findings support the preference for an early mobilization protocol in cSDH patients over mandatory bed rest strategies.",chronic subdural hematoma;early mobilization;functional outcome;recurrence;trauma;traumatic brain injury,trauma
Epidemiological Profile of Victim Patients of Facial Canine and Human Bites in a Public Hospital.,"Bites are among the most common types of trauma to which humans are exposed. The possibility of disfiguring lesions and the transmission of infectious diseases with high morbidity make this trauma a public health problem. This was a retrospective, descriptive study that analyzed the medical records of patients treated at the Emergency Unit of the Plastic Surgery Service of the Asa Norte Regional Hospital from March 2019 to March 2020. The variables analyzed included age, sex, origin, time interval from aggression to hospital care, aggressor agent, wound site, lesion characteristics, and treatment. A total of 103 patients with a mean age of 25 years were evaluated. Most patients were male (57.3%), and 73.8% were from the Federal District. The most common type of treatment was direct suturing in 77.7% of cases, followed by local flaps (15.5%) or grafts (4.9%). There were no deaths or infections reported. The predominant profile of a facial bite victim is a young male adult living in the Federal District, bitten by a canine and treated with direct sutures. Adequate treatment for animal bites should include prevention of infection, such as rabies and tetanus, as well as primary wound closure for achieving a better prognosis and satisfactory esthetics for the patient.",,trauma
Pharmacologic Management of Pediatric Burns.,"Many pediatric patients with burn injuries may be initially treated in a hospital where pediatric specialized care, including resources and trained personnel may be limited. This includes resuscitation in adult emergency departments and inpatient care in mixed adult-pediatric burn units. The intent of this review is to provide a compilation of topics for the adult trained pharmacist or other healthcare practitioner on the management of pediatric patients with burn injuries. This article focuses on several key areas of pharmacologic burn management in the pediatric patient that may differ from the adult patient, including pain and sedation, fluid resuscitation, nutrition support, antimicrobial selection, anticoagulation, and inhalation injury. It is important that all clinicians have resources to help optimize management of burn injuries in the pediatric population as, in addition to burn injury itself, pediatric patients have different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics affecting which medications are utilized and how they are dosed. This article highlights several key differences between pediatric and adult patients, providing an additional resource to assist adult trained pharmacists or other healthcare practitioners with making clinical decisions in the pediatric burn population.",burn;critical care;emergency department;intensive care units pediatric;pediatrics,trauma
Cavernous Malformations and Hemangioblastomas of the Spinal Cord Show Distinct Differences in Clinical Course - A Retrospective Single-Center Analysis of 112 Patients.,"Retrospective cohort study. Cavernous malformations (CMs) and hemangioblastomas (HBs) of the spinal cord exhibit distinct differences in histopathology but similarities in the neurological course. The aim of our study was to analyze the clinical differences between the vascular pathologies and a benign tumor of the spinal cord in a perioperative situation. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who had undergone surgery for lesions in the spinal cord between 1984 and 2015. Patients were screened for CMs and HBs as the primary inclusion criteria. General patient information, surgical data, and disease-specific data were collected from the records. Cooper-Epstein scores for clinical symptoms were evaluated preoperatively, at discharge, and at the 6-month follow-up. A total of 112 patients were included, of which 46 had been diagnosed with CMs and 66 with HBs. Patients with CMs often demonstrated more preoperative neurological deterioration compared to those with HBs (P < .05); accordingly, in took longer to diagnose HBs. Complete resection was possible for 96.8% of all patients with CMs and 90% of those with HBs. At the 6-month follow-up, patients with HBs more often presented with persisting neurologic impairment of the upper extremities compared to the CM patients (P < .001). CMs and HBs of the spinal cord have similarities but also exhibit significant differences in neurological presentation and perioperative course. Surgical therapy is the treatment of choice for symptomatic lesions, and complete surgical resection is possible in the majority of cases for both entities. Neurologic outcomes are usually favorable, although patients with HBs retain neurologic deficits more often.",cavernous malformations;hemangioblastomas;postoperative outcome;spinal cord;treatment,trauma
Feasibility of USG Guided Objective Initial Assessment of Pupillary Size and Pupillary Reflexes Versus Clinical Examination in Patients With Altered Mental Status: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Pupillary assessment is an important part of the neurological assessment which provides vital information in critically ill patients. However, clinical pupillary assessment is subjective. The ultrasound-guided pupillary examination is objective. There are limited pieces of literature regarding its use in assessing patients with altered mental status. So, we studied the extent of agreement of B-mode ultrasound with clinical examination for assessment of the pupillary size and reflex in patients with altered mental status. The primary objective was to determine the extent of agreement between clinical examination and ultrasound-based examination for assessing pupillary reflex and size in patients with altered mental status in two settings (trauma and non-trauma patients). Exactly 200 subjects (158 males, mean [range] age 43.56 [18-92 years]) with no history of partial globe rupture or dementia were included in this cross-sectional study from March 2019 to March 2020. B-mode ultrasound was performed with the subject's eyes closed using a 7-12 MHz linear probe and a standardized light stimulus. ICC score, paired t-test, kappa, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Bland-Altman plots were used for statistical analysis. The clinical-USG agreement for pupillary light reflex examination (Pupillary Diameter [PD] at rest, after direct light stimulation [Dstim ] and consensual light stimulation [Cstim ]) was excellent (ICC, 0.93-0.96). The Kappa coefficient (0.74 ± 0.07) showed an agreement of 87.36% between clinical and USG examination for pupillary reflex (reactive or non-reactive). USG-guided pupillary examination proves to be a better adjunct to neurological assessment in patients with altered mental status.",POCUS;altered mental status;pupillary assessment;pupillary light reflex examination;pupillary ultrasound,trauma
Usability Enhancements to a Prototype Clinical Decision Support System for Combat Medics.,"A Clinical Decision Support System that provides just-in-time medical guidance at the point of injury is being developed. To develop a user interface, a user-centered design approach was taken. To evaluate the system, personas of the users were created, a comparative analysis of the system against the Tactical Combat Casualty Care Card and Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit was completed, and user testing was performed. Many design recommendations were gathered from the user-centered design approach including replacing buttons with a homunculus, replacing prompts with a tree and node system, and allowing more user freedom in working with the system. Through multiple different evaluations, design recommendations for a clinical decision support system were implemented in an iterative process. More iterations and more formalized user testing are planned to maximize the usability of the system.",,trauma
The Design and Application of a Health Behavioral Change (HBC) Roadmap.,"To assist in addressing medical readiness challenges, the DOD has established various Centers of Excellence to focus efforts to protect, treat, train, and educate service members concerning risks and potential injuries. Using the hearing health domain as a pilot, this effort used DOD methods to evaluate all facets of successful health behavior change (HBC) practices within a military environment and developed a framework and pathway for HBC. The DOD uses the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) to ensure new DOD capabilities are identified and fielded in a manner that is interoperable, resilient, and supportables. The study sponsor for the Health Behavioral Change Framework study is the Defense Health Agency Deputy Assistant Director for Research and Engineering (R&E). The main objective of this group was to ensure that final products would both meet the requirements as defined by the JCIDS process, as well as be used by the operational force in addressing HBCs that improve readiness of the joint force. The Health Behavior Change Guidebook applies to all organizations across the DOD and military health system that may participate in or support specific tasks related to the design, conduct, and assessment of the HBC campaign. The advantage of the process is the ability to define gaps and solutions at an enterprise level. The HBC framework can be applied to a variety of health domains to include behavioral health. Use of the ""Guidebook for Design, Conduct and Assessment of Health Behavior Change Campaign Within the DOD"" and DOTMLPF-P analysis will move Defense Health Agency toward more disciplined use of the JCIDS. The HBC framework allowed the Hearing Center of Excellence to lead the hearing health community to create a capability-based assessment for hearing HBC.",,trauma
"TCCC Decision Support With Machine Learning Prediction of Hemorrhage Risk, Shock Probability.","Expected future delays in evacuation during near-peer conflicts in remote locales are expected to require extended care including prolonged field care over hours to days. Such delays can increase potential complications, such as insufficient blood flow (shock), bloodstream infection (sepsis), internal bleeding (hemorrhage), and require more complex treatment beyond stabilization. The Trauma Triage Treatment and Training Decision Support (4TDS) system is a real-time decision support system to monitor casualty health and identify such complications. The 4TDS software prototype operates on an Android smart phone or tablet configured for use in the DoD Nett Warrior program. It includes machine learning models to evaluate trends in six vital signs streamed from a sensor placed on a casualty to identify shock probability, internal hemorrhage risk, and need for a massive transfusion. The project team used a mixed methods approach to create and evaluate the system including literature review, rapid prototyping, design requirements review, agile development, an algorithm ""silent test,"" and usability assessments with novice to expert medics from all three services. Both models, shock (showing an accuracy of 0.83) and hemorrhage/massive transfusion protocol, were successfully validated using externally collected data. All usability assessment participants completed refresher training scenarios and were able to accurately assess a simulated casualty's condition using the phone prototype. Mean responses to statements on evaluation criteria [e.g., fit with Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC), ease of use, and decision confidence] fell at five or above on a 7-point scale, indicating strong support. Participatory design ensured 4TDS and machine learning models reflect medic and clinician mental models and work processes and built support among potential users should the system transition to operational use. Validation results can support 4TDS readiness for FDA 510k clearance as a Class II medical device.",,trauma
Robust Multi-View Fracture Detection in the Presence of Other Abnormalities Using HAMIL-Net.,"Foot and ankle fractures are the most common military health problem. Automated diagnosis can save time and personnel. It is crucial to distinguish fractures not only from normal healthy cases, but also robust against the presence of other orthopedic pathologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning has been shown to be promising. Previously, we have developed HAMIL-Net to automatically detect orthopedic injuries for upper extremity injuries. In this research, we investigated the performance of HAMIL-Net for detecting foot and ankle fractures in the presence of other abnormalities. HAMIL-Net is a novel deep neural network consisting of a hierarchical attention layer followed by a multiple-instance learning layer. The design allowed it to deal with imaging studies with multiple views. We used 148K musculoskeletal imaging studies for 51K Veterans at VA San Diego in the past 20 years to create datasets for this research. We annotated each study by a semi-automated pipeline leveraging radiology reports written by board-certified radiologists and extracting findings with a natural language processing tool and manually validated the annotations. HAMIL-Net can be trained with study-level, multiple-view examples, and detect foot and ankle fractures with a 0.87 area under the receiver operational curve, but the performance dropped when tested by cases including other abnormalities. By integrating a fracture specialized model with one that detecting a broad range of abnormalities, HAMIL-Net's accuracy of detecting any abnormality improved from 0.53 to 0.77 and F-score from 0.46 to 0.86. We also reported HAMIL-Net's performance under different study types including for young (age 18-35) patients. Automated fracture detection is promising but to be deployed in clinical use, presence of other abnormalities must be considered to deliver its full benefit. Our results with HAMIL-Net showed that considering other abnormalities improved fracture detection and allowed for incidental findings of other musculoskeletal abnormalities pertinent or superimposed on fractures.",,trauma
Local Antibiotic Therapy for Open Long Bone Fractures: Appropriate Prophylaxis or Unnecessary Exposure for the Orthopedic Trauma Patient?,"Prophylactic local antibiotic therapy (LAbT) to prevent infection in open long bone fracture (OLBF) patients has been in use for many decades despite lack of definitive evidence confirming a beneficial effect. We aimed to evaluate the effect of LAbT on outcomes of OLBF patients on a nationwide scale. In this retrospective analysis of 2017-2018 American College of Surgeons-Trauma Quality Improvement Program database, all adult (≥18 years) patients with isolated OLBF (non-extremity-Abbreviated Injury Scale < 3) were included. We excluded early deaths (<24 h) and those who had burns or non-extremity surgery. Outcomes were infectious complications (superficial surgical site infection, deep superficial surgical site infection, osteomyelitis, or sepsis), unplanned return to operating room, and hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS). Patients were stratified into two groups: those who received LAbT and those who did not receive LAbT (No-LAbT). Propensity score matching (1:3) and chi-square tests were performed. A total of 61,337 isolated OLBF patients were identified, among whom 2,304 patients were matched (LAbT: 576; No-LAbT: 1,728). Both groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. Mean age was 43 ± 17 years, 75% were male, 14% had penetrating injuries, and the median extremity-Abbreviated Injury Scale was 1 (1-2). Most common fracture locations were tibia (66%), fibula (49%), femur (24%), and ulna (11%). About 52% of patients underwent external fixation, 79% underwent internal fixation, and 86% underwent surgical debridement. The median time to LAbT was 17 (5-72) h, and the median time to debridement was 7 (3-15) h (85% within 24 h). The LAbT group had similar rates of infectious complications (3.5% vs. 2.5%, P = 0.24) and unplanned return to the operating room (2.3% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.74) compared to the No-LAbT group. Patients who received LAbT had longer hospital LOS (16 [10-29] vs. 14 [9-24] days, P < 0.001) but similar intensive care unit LOS (4 [3-9] vs. 4 [2-7] days, P = 0.19). Our findings indicate that prophylactic LAbT for OLBF may not be beneficial over well-established standards of care such as early surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics. Prospective studies evaluating the efficacy, risks, costs, and indications of adjuvant LAbT for OLBF are warranted.",,trauma
Intraoperative Use of Compensatory Reserve Measurement in Orthotopic Liver Transplant: Improved Sensitivity for the Prediction of Hypovolemic Events.,"The compensatory reserve measurement (CRM) is a continuous non-invasive monitoring technology that measures the summation of all physiological mechanisms involved in the compensatory response to central hypovolemia. The CRM is displayed on a 0% to 100% scale. The objective of this study is to characterize the use of CRM in the operative setting and determine its ability to predict hypovolemic events compared to standard vital signs. Orthotopic liver transplant was used as the reference procedure because of the predictable occurrence of significant hemodynamic shifts. A prospective observational cohort study was conducted on 22 consecutive patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant. The subjects were monitored in accordance with the standard of care. The CRM data were collected concurrently with intraoperative staff blinded to the outputs. The data were stored on secure devices on encrypted files. Based on prior literature, subgroup analysis was performed for high-tolerance (good compensators) and low-tolerance (poor compensators) groups, which was based on a shock index threshold of 0.9. Threshold events were defined as follows: CRM below 60% (CRM60), systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 90 mmHg (SBP90), and heart rate (HR) above 100 beats per minute (HR100). Complete data were captured in 22 subjects as a result of device malfunction or procedure cancellation. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the detection of hypovolemia at the time of the event. CRM60 was the most sensitive (62.6%) when compared to other threshold measures such as SBP90 (30.6%), HR100 (23.1%), elevated lactate (54.6%), and a drop in hemoglobin (41.7%). The number of patients meeting the CRM60 threshold at the time of the first transfusion (TFX) was higher when compared to SBP90 and HR100 in the overall group (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively) and both the high-tolerance (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively) and low-tolerance groups (P = .016 and P = .001, respectively). Similar results supporting the higher sensitivity of CRM were observed when comparing the number of patients below the threshold at the time of the first vasopressor administration. Start time was standardized so that the time-to-threshold signals for hemodynamic and laboratory parameters could be compared. The median time-to-CRM signal detection before the TFX event was -15.0 minutes (i.e., 15 minutes before TFX). There was no difference when compared to the SBP threshold (median time -5.0 minutes, P = .64) but was significantly sooner when compared to HR (P = .006), lactate (P = .002), and hemoglobin (P < .001). At the time of the first TFX, the CRM had a higher rate of detection of a hypovolemic event compared to SBP and HR, indicating a higher sensitivity for the detection of the first hypovolemic event. When combined with all hypovolemic events, sensitivity analysis showed that CRM60 provides the earlier predictive capability. Given that SBP is the clinical standard of care for the initiation of TFX, the finding that median time to event detection was statistically similar between CRM60 and SBP90 was not unexpected. When compared to other measures of hypovolemia, the CRM consistently showed earlier detection of hypovolemic events. Although this study had a small sample size, it produced significant results and can serve as a proof of concept for future large-scale studies.",,trauma
Provider Perceptions of Oxygenation Strategies for Critically Ill Trauma Patients With and Without Moderate-to-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Hypoxia and hyperoxia (pulse oximetry [SpO2] > 96%) are associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. However, provider practices regarding oxygenation in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients are unknown. This study assesses views on oxygenation of critically ill trauma patients with and without TBI and how this varies between Neurological ICU (NeuroICU) and Surgical-Trauma ICU (STICU) providers. This is a cross-sectional survey of Level I trauma center's NeuroICU and STICU providers. We used Likert scales, yes-no questions, and multiple-choice case-based scenarios to characterize provider views on oxygenation with descriptive statistics to characterize responses. Significant differences regarding TBI and non-TBI patients or NeuroICU and STICU providers were determined using Fisher's exact test and a P-value of .05. A total of 83 providers initiated the survey, and 53 providers completed it. Most providers identified a threshold SpO2 < 92% for the administration of supplemental oxygen in critically ill TBI patients. A total of 9% of providers ""somewhat or completely agreed"" that they were more likely to give supplemental oxygen to a critically ill trauma patient with TBI than one without TBI and the same SpO2. A total of 48% of providers selected an SpO2 < 90% as the point at which supplemental oxygen should be initiated in patients without TBI, compared to 27% of providers in patients with TBI (P < .01). This threshold for supplemental oxygen use varied by provider type for non-TBI patients, but not for TBI patients (30% NeuroICU and 69% STICU providers selected SpO2 < 90% in non-TBI, P < .05; 30% NeuroICU and 35% STICU providers selected SpO2 < 90% in TBI, P = .85). Critical care providers at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital approach the oxygenation of critically ill trauma patients with and without TBI differently. Specifically, critical care respondents accepted a different lower oxygen saturation threshold for TBI and non-TBI patients. NeuroICU and STICU respondents differed in their threshold for the down-titration of supplemental oxygen. Targeted education for critical care providers may reduce these discrepancies and optimize oxygen use.",,trauma
Trauma THOMPSON: Clinical Decision Support for the Frontline Medic.,"U.S. Military healthcare providers increasingly perform prolonged casualty care because of operations in settings with prolonged evacuation times. Varied training and experience mean that this care may fall to providers unfamiliar with providing critical care. Telemedicine tools with audiovisual capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI), and augmented reality (AR) can enhance inexperienced personnel's competence and confidence when providing prolonged casualty care. Furthermore, implementing offline functionality provides assistance options in communications-limited settings. The intent of the Trauma TeleHelper for Operational Medical Procedure Support and Offline Network (THOMPSON) is to develop (1) a voice-controlled mobile application with video references for procedural guidance, (2) audio narration of each video using procedure mentoring scripts, and (3) an AI-guided intervention system using AR overlay and voice command to create immersive video modeling. These capabilities will be available offline and in downloadable format. The Trauma THOMPSON platform is in development. Focus groups of subject matter experts will identify appropriate procedures and best practices. Procedural video recordings will be collected to develop reference materials for the Trauma THOMPSON mobile application and to train a machine learning algorithm on action recognition and anticipation. Finally, an efficacy evaluation of the application will be conducted in a simulated environment. Preliminary video collection has been initiated for tube thoracostomy, needle decompression, cricothyrotomy, intraosseous access, and tourniquet application. Initial results from the machine learning algorithm show action recognition and anticipation accuracies of 20.1% and 11.4%, respectively, in unscripted datasets ""in the wild,"" notably on a limited dataset. This system performs over 100 times better than a random prediction. Developing a platform to provide real-time, offline support will deliver the benefits of synchronous expert advice within communications-limited and remote environments. Trauma THOMPSON has the potential to fill an important gap for clinical decision support tools in these settings.",,trauma
Seasonality of Microbiology of Combat-Related Wounds and Wound Infections in Afghanistan.,"Battlefield-related wound infections are a significant source of morbidity among combat casualties. Seasonality of these infections was demonstrated in previous conflicts (e.g., Korea) but has not been described with trauma-related health care-associated infections from the war in Afghanistan. The study population included military personnel wounded in Afghanistan (2009-2014) medevac'd to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and transitioned to participating military hospitals in the United States with clinical suspicion of wound infections and wound cultures collected ≤7 days post-injury. Analysis was limited to the first wound culture from individuals. Infecting isolates were collected from skin and soft-tissue infections, osteomyelitis, and burn soft-tissue infections. Data were analyzed by season (winter [ December 1-February 28/29], spring [March 1-May 31], summer [June 1-August 31], and fall [September 1-November 30]). Among 316 patients, 297 (94.0%) sustained blast injuries with a median injury severity score and days from injury to initial culture of 33 and 3.5, respectively. Although all patients had a clinical suspicion of a wound infection, a diagnosis was confirmed in 198 (63%) patients. Gram-negative bacilli (59.5% of 316) were more commonly isolated from wound cultures in summer (68.1%) and fall (67.1%) versus winter (43.9%) and spring (45.1%; P < .001). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli (21.8%) were more common in summer (21.8%) and fall (30.6%) versus winter (7.3%) and spring (19.7%; P = .028). Findings were similar for infecting Gram-negative bacilli (72.7% of 198)-summer (79.5%) and fall (83.6%; P = .001)-and infecting MDR Gram-negative bacilli (27.3% of 198)-summer (25.6%) and fall (41.8%; P = .015). Infecting anaerobes were more common in winter (40%) compared to fall (11%; P = .036). Gram-positive organisms were not significantly different by season. Gram-negative bacilli, including infecting MDR Gram-negative bacilli, were more commonly recovered in summer/fall months from service members injured in Afghanistan. This may have implications for empiric antibiotic coverage during these months.",,trauma
"Continued Development and Testing of a Novel Steerable Chest Tube, Extendable Infusion Cannula, and Portable Suction-Infusion Pump for Use in Austere and Transport Environments to Prevent Retained Hemothorax.","With blunt and penetrating trauma to the chest, warfighters frequently suffer from hemothorax. Optimal management requires the placement of a chest tube to evacuate the blood. Malposition of the tube may be a causative factor of inadequate drainage (retained hemothorax). As a potential solution, we developed a previously reported steerable chest tube allowing accurate placement into a desired location to enhance effectiveness. To provide assisted aspiration, we developed a portable, battery-operated suction device capable of simultaneous or sequential infusion. This report details the ongoing progress of this project. Updated steerable tube and pump prototypes were designed and produced. The tubes were tested for feasibility in two pigs and one cadaver by fluoroscopically comparing tip positions after insertion by a number of providers. Measured drainage volumes comparing standard vs. steerable tubes after pleural infusion of 1,000 mL of saline in two pigs were compared. Testing of the pump focused on the accuracy of suction and volume functions. The steerable tube prototype consists of sequentially bonded segments of differing flexibility and an ergonomic tensioning handle. The portable suction pump accurately provides up to 80 cmH2O of suction, an infusion capability of up to 10 mL/min, and a 950 mL removable reservoir canister. After minimal training, providers easily and repeatedly placed the tip of the steerable tube in the lateral diaphragmatic sulcus in animals and cadavers. Arc was limited to the distal segment. Compared to a standard tube, the steerable tube placed along the diaphragm improved pleural fluid drainage volumes by 17%, although this did not reach statistical significance in six trials. These new prototypes represent substantial improvements and were performed according to expectations. We believe that this steerable chest tube and portable suction-infusion pump can be effectively used for warfighters with chest injuries in austere environments.",,trauma
Early Enteral Nutrition in Aeromedically Evacuated Critically Ill/Injured Patients With a Resultant Validation Algorithm for the Theater Validating Flight Surgeon.,"Early enteral feeding in critically ill/injured patients promotes gut integrity and immunocompetence and reduces infections and intensive care unit/hospital stays. Aeromedical evacuation (AE) often takes place concurrently. As a result, AE and early enteral feeding should be inseparable. This retrospective descriptive study employed AE enteral nutrition (EN) data (2007-2019) collected from patients who were U.S. citizens and mechanically ventilated. The dataset was created from the En Route Critical Care, Transportation Command Regulating and Command and Control Evacuation System, and Theater Medical Data Store databases. Comparisons were performed between patients extracted and patients not extracted, patients treated with EN and patients treated without EN, and within the EN group, between AE Fed and AE Withheld. The impact of the nutrition support in the Joint Trauma System Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) was assessed using the 'before' and 'after' methodology. An uptick in feeding rates was found after the 2010 CPG, 15% → 17%. With the next two CPG iterations, rates rose significantly, 17% → 48%. Concurrently, AE feeding holds rose significantly, 10% → 24%, later dropping to 17%. In addition, little difference was found between those patients not enterally fed preflight and those enterally fed across collected demographic, mission, and clinical parameters. Likewise, no difference was found between those enterally fed during AE and those withheld. Yet, 83% of the study's patients were not fed, and 18% of those that were fed had feeding withheld for AE. It appeared that the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) reinforced the value of feeding, but may well have sensitized to the threat of aspiration. It also appeared that early enteral feeding was underprescribed and AE feeding withholds were overprescribed. Consequently, an algorithm was devised for the Theater Validating Flight Surgeon, bearing in mind relevant preflight/inflight/clinical issues, with prescriptions designed to boost feeding, diminish AE withholding, and minimize complications.",,trauma
Recommendations for a Military Health System Auditory Blast Injury Prevention Standard.,"Although existing auditory injury prevention standards benefit warfighters, the Department of Defense could do more to understand and address auditory injuries (e.g., hearing loss, tinnitus, and central processing deficits) among service members. The Blast Injury Prevention Standards Recommendation (BIPSR) Process is designed to address the needs of all the Military Services for biomedically valid Military Health System (MHS) Blast Injury Prevention Standards. Through the BIPSR Process, stakeholders provided their intended uses and requested functionalities for an MHS Blast Injury Prevention Standard. The BIPSR Process established a broad-based, non-advocacy panel of auditory injury Subject Matter Expert (SME) Panel with members drawn from industry, academia, and government. The SME Panel selected evaluation factors, weighted priorities, and then evaluated the resulting candidate MHS Auditory Blast Injury Prevention Standards against the evaluation criteria. The SME Panel members provided rationales for their decisions, documented discussions, and used iterative rounds of feedback to promote consensus building among members. The BIPSR Process used multi-attribute utility theory to combine members' evaluations and compare the candidate standards. The SME Panel identified and collated information about existing auditory injury datasets to identify gaps and promote data sharing and comprehensive evaluations of standards for preventing auditory blast injury. The panel evaluated the candidate standards and developed recommendations for an MHS Blast Injury Prevention Standard. The BIPSR Process illuminated important characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of candidate standards and existing datasets (e.g., limited human exposure data to evaluate the validity of injury prediction) for auditory blast injury prevention. The evaluation resulted in the recommendation to use the 8-hour Equivalent Level (LAeq8hr) as the interim MHS Auditory Blast Injury Prevention Standard while the community performs additional research to fill critical knowledge gaps.",,trauma
Head Flail Corridors From Sled Impact Acceleration Tests for Use in Occupant-Centric Vehicle Design.,"In aircraft crashes, injuries to the head and upper torso are frequently reported, with head injury reported most frequently of all body regions. Because preventing flail of the head and body is of utmost importance for occupant survival, the Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide (ACSDG), the guide to crashworthy aircraft design, published flail envelopes. However, the ACSDG flail envelopes are based on a single test with an anthropomorphic test device subjected to a frontal acceleration. In this article, human research volunteer (HRV) response data are used to calculate head flail corridors and evaluate the ACSDG flail envelopes. Data from HRV sled tests were obtained from the historical Naval Biodynamics Laboratory collection of the Biodynamics Data Resource. Digitized high-speed film for each test was tracked and processed to represent the head flail response in a format amenable to corridor development. Time-based and position-based head flail corridors were developed for groups of exposure-matched tests and then compared to the ACSDG flail envelopes. A collection of 714 HRV sled tests conducted in six different impact directions ranging from 3 to 15 g was used to develop time-based and position-based head flail corridors for 39 match groups. The ACSDG vertical limit and anteroposterior limit and curve were not exceeded by the flail corridors, but the lateral limit and curve were exceeded by 4.6 cm to 15.8 cm. The flail corridors provide a useful baseline for representing the well-restrained occupant response at lower, non-injurious exposure levels and across multiple impact directions. Under these conditions, the ACSDG lateral limit and curve are not adequate. At higher exposure levels or with modified restraints, seating, or equipment, the ACSDG vertical limit and anteroposterior limit and curves may also be inadequate.",,trauma
Chronic Pain and Childhood Adversity Experiences Among U.S. Military Personnel.,"Chronic pain in a military population is prevalent, is costly, and can limit daily activities and affect soldier readiness. It has been associated with childhood adversity (CA) within the veteran, adult, and pediatric populations. Given the need to maximize soldier resiliency, an examination of the link between CA and chronic pain in an active duty population for a better understanding that informs treatment options is warranted. The analytic sample comprised 32 men and 8 women drawn from a retrospective review of 203 intake assessments at an interdisciplinary pain management center. We identified a group (CA) of 20 patients who reported a history of pre-adolescent sexual abuse or living in an ""abusive"" childhood home and compared it with a control group (no-CA) of 20 patients, matched for age, gender, pain history duration, and pain problem. Validated measures were used to assess pain intensity, interference in functioning and well-being, emotional sequelae of pain as reflected in symptoms of depression and anxiety, and pain-related catastrophic thinking. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent samples t-test analyses. Differences in current, worst, and average pain ratings were non-significant between groups. The CA group reported significantly greater effect of pain on mood (mean: 6.20 versus 4.25, P < .02) and showed a trend toward higher pain interference in functioning (mean: 17.70 versus 15.05, P = .053). The CA patients had significantly more serious depression (mean: 12.65 versus 4.50, P < .001) and anxiety symptoms (mean: 10.60 versus 2.35, P < .001) and significantly higher pain catastrophizing tendency (mean: 30.05 versus 20.50, P < .03). Overall, the findings suggest that childhood trauma should be considered by providers when treating depression and anxiety in soldiers with chronic pain. Being mindful of trauma-informed care may have implications, perhaps, for cases perceived as treatment resistant.",,trauma
Strain Response of an Anatomically Accurate Nonhuman Primate Finite Element Brain Model Under Sagittal Loading.,"Prevention and treatment of traumatic brain injuries is critical to preserving soldier brain health. Laboratory studies are commonly used to reproduce injuries, understand injury mechanisms, and develop tolerance limits; however, this approach has limitations for studying brain injury, which requires a physiological response. The nonhuman primate (NHP) has been used as an effective model for investigating brain injury for many years. Prior research using the NHP provides a valuable resource to leverage using modern analysis and modeling techniques to improve our understanding of brain injury. The objectives of the present study are to develop an anatomically accurate finite element model of the NHP and determine regional brain responses using previously collected NHP data. The finite element model was developed using a neuroimaging-based anatomical atlas of the rhesus macaque that includes both cortical and subcortical structures. Head kinematic data from 10 sagittal NHP experiments, four +Gx (rearward) and six -Gx (frontal), were used to test model stability and obtain brain strain responses from multiple severities and vectors. For +Gx tests, the whole-brain cumulative strain damage measure exceeding a strain threshold of 0.15 (CSDM15) ranged from 0.28 to 0.89, and 95th percentile of the whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS95) ranged from 0.21 to 0.59. For -Gx tests, whole-brain CSDM15 ranged from 0.02 to 0.66, and whole-brain MPS95 ranged from 0.08 to 0.39. Recognizing that NHPs are the closest surrogate to humans combined with the limitations of conducting brain injury research in the laboratory, a detailed anatomically accurate finite element model of an NHP was developed and exercised using previously collected data from the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory. The presently developed model can be used to conduct additional analyses to act as pilot data for the design of newer experiments with statistical power because of the sensitivity and resources needed to conduct experiments with NHPs.",,trauma
Ultrasound-Activated Piezoelectric Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Trifluoroethylene Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering Applications.,"Severe peripheral nervous system (PNS) injuries have limited options for therapeutic solutions to regain functional recovery. This can be attributed in part to the lack of regeneration pathways promoted by recapitulating chemical, physical, and electrical cues to direct nerve guidance. To address this, we examined ultrasonic stimulation of a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride-triflouroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) scaffold as a potentially clinically relevant therapy for PNS regeneration. Owing to the piezoelectric modality of PVDF-TrFE, we hypothesize that ultrasound stimulation will activate the scaffold to electrically stimulate cells in response to the mechanical deformation mediated by sound waves. Biocompatible PVDF-TrFE scaffolds were fabricated to be used as an ultrasound-activated, piezoelectric biomaterial to enhance cellular activity for PNS applications. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were cultured on PVDF-TrFE nanofibers and stimulated with low-, medium-, or high-powered ultrasound. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed on fibroblasts to measure the metabolic activity of the cells following stimulation. MTT assays showed that ultrasound-stimulated fibroblasts on PVDF-TrFE scaffolds had increased metabolic activity as power was increased, whereas on plain polystyrene, an opposite trend was observed where cells had a decreased metabolic activity with ascending levels of ultrasound power. Ultrasound-stimulated PVDF-TrFE nanofibers hold exciting potential as a therapy for PNS injuries by promoting increased metabolic activity and proliferation. The ability to noninvasively stimulate implantable piezoelectric nanofibers to promote mechanical and electrical stimulation for nerve repair offers a promising benefit to severe trauma patients.",,trauma
Impact of Blast Overpressure on the Pharmacokinetics of Various Antibiotics in Sprague Dawley Rats.,"Combat injuries are complex and multimodal. Most injuries to the extremities occur because of explosive devices such as improvised explosive devices. Blast exposure dramatically increases the risk of infection in combat wounds, and there is limited available information on the best antibiotic treatments for these injuries. We previously demonstrated that mice exposed to blast displayed a delayed clearance of cefazolin from the plasma and liver; further semi-mechanistic modeling determined that cefazolin concentrations in the skin of these mice were reduced. Our objective was to investigate the effects of blast on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics of different types used for the treatment of combat wounds in the rat model. Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to blast overpressure followed by injection of a bolus of animal equivalent doses of an antibiotic (cefazolin, cefepime, ertapenem, or clindamycin) into the tail vein at 1-hour post-blast exposure. Blood was collected at predetermined time points via repeated sampling from the tail vein. Animals were also euthanized at predetermined time points, at which time liver, kidney, skin, and blood via cardiac puncture were collected. Antibiotic concentrations were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Blast-exposed rats exhibited a similar rate of clearance compared to non-blasted rats in the blood, liver, kidney, and skin, which is inconsistent with the data regarding cefazolin in blast-exposed mice. Our results in rats do not recapitulate our previous observation of delayed cefazolin clearance in mice following the blast overpressure exposure. Although using rats permitted us to collect multiple blood samples from the same animals, rats may not be a suitable model for measuring the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics following blast. The interpretation of the results may be challenging because of variation in data among rat subjects in the same sample groups.",,trauma
Developing a Comparative Effective Methodology for Technology Usability During a Simulated Casualty Event.,"Future combat environments will be complex, making effective care for multi-domain battlefield injuries more challenging. Technology and resources are essential to reduce provider burden enabling more accurate assessments, decision-making support, expanded treatment, and outcome improvements. Experimentation exercises to evaluate concepts and technologies to incorporate into the Army's future force ensure rapid and continuous integration across air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace domains to overmatch adversaries. A medical lane was first integrated on the communications networks for experimentation in 2022. We describe a project to develop a method for empirically comparing devices intended to support combat casualty care through high-fidelity simulation in preparation for an Army experimentation exercise. Six medics participated in a series of high-fidelity simulation medical casualty injury scenarios with and without technology devices. The participants provided usability information about their care delivery experiences using the System Usability Scale and Adapted Telehealth Usability Questionnaire-Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Command and qualitative feedback. A comparative effectiveness design compared the devices regarding their usability, size, weight, and power with the addition of cost, connectivity, and cyber security, and the qualitative feedback this methodology holistically assessed the technologies as they were applied in the combat casualty care scenario. Results were used by decision makers to determine technology inclusion in experimentation exercise, develop proof of concept methodology to scale for the exercise, and provide technology developers feedback for iterative updates of their devices before participation in experimentation exercise. This project supports the body of simulation studies conducted to understand combat casualty care. It is one of few empirical medical technology assessments with medical personnel end user input that has been reported. The methodology incorporates a user-centered design for rapid technology improvements before fielding.",,trauma
Integrating Battlefield Documentation into Virtual Reality Medical Simulation Training: Virtual Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit (BATDOK).,"Clinical documentation is an essential component of the provision of medical care, enabling continuity of information across provider and site handoffs. This is particularly important in the combat casualty care setting when a single casualty may be treated by four or more or five completely disparate teams across the roles of care. The Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit (BATDOK) is a digital battlefield clinical documentation system developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory to address this need. To support the deployment of this tool, we integrated BATDOK into a commercially available virtual reality (VR) medical simulation platform used by the U.S. Air Force and Defense Health Agency personnel in order to provide an immersive simulation training experience which included battlefield documentation. A multidisciplinary team consisting of medical educators, VR simulation engineers, emergency physicians and pararescuemen, and BATDOK developers first developed a specification for a virtual BATDOK capability, including a detailed listing of learning objectives, critical interfaces and task plans, and sensor integrations. These specifications were then implemented into the commercially available Virtual Advancement of Learning for Operational Readiness VR Medical Simulation System and underwent developmental testing and evaluation during pararescueman training exercises at the Air Force Special Operations Command Special Operations Center for Medical Integration and Development. The BATDOK capability was successfully implemented within the VR Medical Simulation System. The capability consisted of a virtual tablet with replicated interfaces and capabilities based on the developed specifications. These capabilities included integrated point-of-care ultrasound capability, multi-patient management, vitals sign monitoring with sensor pairing and continuous monitoring, mechanism of injury documentation (including injury pattern documentation), intervention logging (including tourniquets, dressing, airways, lines, tubes and drains, splints, fluids, and medications), and event logging. The capability was found to be operational and in alignment with learning objectives and user acceptance goals.",,trauma
Association of Prehospital Neck Wound Survivability and Battlefield Medical Evacuation Time in Afghanistan.,"The U.S. Military's Golden Hour policy led to improved warfighter survivability during the Global War on Terror. The policy's success is well-documented, but a categorical evaluation and stratification of medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) times based on combat injury is lacking. We queried the Department of Defense Joint Trauma System Prehospital Trauma Registry for casualties with documented penetrating neck trauma in Afghanistan requiring battlefield MEDEVAC from June 15, 2009, through February 1, 2021. Casualties were excluded if the time from the point of injury to reach higher level medical care was not documented, listed as zero, or exceeded 4 hours. They were also excluded if demographic data were incomplete or deemed unreliable or if their injuries occurred outside of Afghanistan.We designed a logistic regression model to test for associations in survivability, adjusting for composite injury severity score, patient age group, and type of next higher level of care reached. We then used our model to interpolate MEDEVAC times associated with 0.1%, 1%, and 10% increased risk of death for an incapacitated casualty with penetrating neck trauma. Of 1,147 encounters, 444 casualties met inclusion criteria. Of these casualties, 430 (96.9%) survived to discharge. Interpolative analysis of our multivariable logistic regression model showed that MEDEVAC times ≥8 minutes, ≥53 minutes, and ≥196 minutes are associated with a 0.1%, 1%, and 10% increased risk of mortality from baseline, respectively. Our data characterize the maximum MEDEVAC times associated with 0.1%, 1%, and 10% increased risk of death from baseline survivability for penetrating battlefield neck trauma in Afghanistan.",,trauma
Pelvis-Sacrum-Lumbar Spine Injury Characteristics From Underbody Blast Loading.,"Combat-related injuries from improvised explosive devices occur commonly to the lower extremity and spine. As the underbody blast impact loading traverses from the seat to pelvis to spine, energy transfer occurs through deformations of the combined pelvis-sacrum-lumbar spine complex, and the time factor plays a role in injury to any of these components. Previous studies have largely ignored the role of the time variable in injuries, injury mechanisms, and warfighter tolerance. The objective of this study is to relate the time or temporal factor using a multi-component, pelvis-sacrum-lumbar spinal column complex model. Intact pelvis-sacrum-spine specimens from pre-screened unembalmed human cadavers were prepared by fixing at the superior end of the lumbar spine, pelvis and abdominal contents were simulated, and a weight was added to the cranial end of the fixation to account for torso effective mass. Prepared specimens were placed on the platform of a custom vertical accelerator device and aligned in a seated soldier posture. An accelerometer was attached to the seat platen of the device to record the time duration to peak velocity. Radiographs and computed tomography images were used to document and associate injuries with time duration. The mean age, stature, weight, body mass index, and bone density of 12 male specimens were as follows: 65 ± 11 years, 1.8 ± 0.01 m, 83 ± 13 kg, 27 ± 5.0 kg/m2, and 114 ± 21 mg/cc. They were equally divided into short, medium, and long time durations: 4.8 ± 0.5, 16.3 ± 7.3, and 34.5 ± 7.5 ms. Most severe injuries associated with the short time duration were to pelvis, although they were to spine for the long time duration. With adequate time for the underbody blast loading to traverse the pelvis-sacrum-spine complex, distal structures are spared while proximal/spine structures sustain severe/unstable injuries. The time factor may have implications in seat and/or seat structure design in future military vehicles to advance warfighter safety.",,trauma
The Association Between Glasgow Coma Scale Scores and PTSD in Military Trauma Casualties: Does Mental Status Following Injury Play a Role in PTSD Development?,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent among military personnel and may arise following a wide range of traumatic exposures. Consciousness level following traumatic injury may play a role in the development of PTSD, but its effects have been primarily investigated in the context of traumatic brain injury. Registry-based study surveying three databases documenting care from point of injury to long-term rehabilitation of traumatic injuries among military personnel. The study population was divided according to Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores upon emergency department admission (GCS scores 15, 13 and 14, 9-12, and 3-8), with PTSD diagnoses being determined according to disability claim records. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to determine the association between GCS score at admission and PTSD. Overall, 3,376 military personnel hospitalized following traumatic injuries between 1997 and 2020 were included. The majority were male (92.3%), with a median age of 20 (interquartile range 19-22) at the injury time. Of these, 569 (16.9%) were diagnosed with PTSD according to disability claims, with a median follow-up time of 10.9 years. PTSD diagnosis was most prevalent (30.3% of patients), with a GCS score of 13 and 14. In the adjusted multivariable model, a GCS score of 13 and 14 was associated with significantly higher odds of PTSD diagnosis when compared to a GCS score of 15 (odds ratio 2.19, 95% CI, 1.21-3.88). The associations of other GCS groupings with PTSD diagnosis were nonsignificant. Minimally impaired consciousness following traumatic injuries is associated with increased odds of PTSD. The role of patient awareness, analgesia, and sedation following an injury in developing PTSD warrants further investigation and could guide early diagnosis and preventive interventions.",,trauma
Utilization of the En Route Aeromedical Patient Movement Form by Critical Care Air Transport Teams.,"Understanding usage patterns of current paper-based documentation can inform the development of electronic documentation forms for en route care. The primary objective was to analyze the frequency of use of each field within the 3899 L Patient Movement Record documented by en route Critical Care Air Transport Teams. Secondary objectives were to identify rarely utilized form fields and to analyze the proportion of verifiable major events documented within the 3899 L form. We performed a retrospective review of 3899 L patient movement records for patients transported via Critical Care Air Transport Teams from January 2019 to December 2019. Scanned 3899 L forms were manually transcribed into a Microsoft Access database for evaluation and analysis. Proportions were calculated for completed fields. Major vital sign event frequency was compared for checkbox fields versus the vital sign flow sheet for each patient. We performed descriptive analyses for the proportion of charts with completed documentation in each evaluated field and the proportion of flow sheet events documented in major event fields. We analyzed 130 records. Fourteen of 18 (77.8%) demographic fields had a 75% or greater completion ratio. Sections with the largest proportion of rarely or never utilized fields (<1.5% completed) were procedures (77.8% of fields) and major events (63.9% of fields). Major event checkboxes had low sensitivity for documented events in the flow sheet: Change in heart rate greater than 20% (1 of 28 patients); increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen requirement of greater than 10% (6 of 23 patients); decrease in mean arterial pressure of greater than 20% (1 in 12 patients); and temperature less than 35.6°C (1 in 13 patients). Many of the current 3899 L fields are highly utilized, but some 3899 L sections contain high proportions of rarely utilized fields. Major event checkboxes did not consistently capture events documented within the in-flight vital sign flow sheet.",,trauma
A Novel Paradigm to Develop Regional Thoracoabdominal Criteria for Behind Armor Blunt Trauma Based on Original Data.,"For behind armor blunt trauma (BABT), recent prominent BABT standards for chest plate define a maximum deformation distance of 44 mm in clay. It was developed for soft body armor applications with limited animal, gelatin, and clay tests. The legacy criterion does not account for differing regional thoracoabdominal tolerances to behind armor-induced injury. This study examines the rationale and approaches used in the legacy BABT clay criterion and presents a novel paradigm to develop thoracoabdominal regional injury risk curves. A review of the original military and law enforcement studies using animals, surrogates, and body armor materials was conducted, and a reanalysis of data was performed. A multiparameter model analysis describes survival-lethality responses using impactor/projectile (mass, diameter, and impact velocity) and specimen (weight and tissue thickness) variables. Binary regression risk curves with ±95% confidence intervals (CIs) and peak deformations from simulant tests are presented. Injury risk curves from 74 goat thorax tests showed that peak deflections of 44.7 mm (±95% CI: 17.6 to 55.4 mm) and 49.9 mm (±95% CI: 24.7 to 60.4 mm) were associated with the 10% and 15% probability of lethal outcomes. 20% gelatin and Roma Plastilina #1 clay were stiffer than goat. The clay was stiffer than 20% gelatin. Penetration diameters showed greater variations (on a test-by-test basis, difference 36-53%) than penetration depths (0-12%) across a range of projectiles and velocities. While the original authors stressed limitations and the importance of additional tests for refining the 44 mm recommendation, they were not pursued. As live swine tests are effective in developing injury criteria and the responses of different areas of the thoracoabdominal regions are different because of anatomy, structure, and function, a new set of swine and human cadaver tests are necessary to develop scaling relationships. Live swine tests are needed to develop incapacitation/lethal injury risk functions; using scaling relationships, human injury criteria can be developed.",,trauma
Effects of a Virtual Reality Game on Children's Anxiety During Dental Procedures (VR-TOOTH): Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Dental fear and anxiety (DFA) is a condition that affects approximately one-quarter of children and adolescents. It is a significant cause for pediatric patients to avoid dental care later in adulthood. Lack of patient cooperation due to DFA can create an environment of stress, often obligating dentists to end appointments prematurely and consider alternative pharmacological treatment options. Virtual reality (VR) use during dental care, providing an immersive experience through sensory stimuli, is potentially an additional nonpharmacologic tool to better manage DFA in children with special health care needs (SHCN) undergoing dental procedures. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of VR immersion as a tool to reduce DFA in pediatric special needs patients undergoing dental procedures. The study also aims to gain insight on parent and health care provider perspectives on the use of VR during dental appointments. This pilot randomized controlled trial study will follow a parallel design including 2 groups: a control group (clinic's standard care using a wall TV) and an experimental group (using a VR game). We will randomize 20 participants to either group. Recruitment will be carried out at the dental clinic of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, a tertiary-quaternary care center that mostly serves pediatric patients with SHCN. The primary outcome will be patient recruitment rates and completion rates of planned procedures. DFA in children will be assessed using both an observation-based proxy assessment with the Venham Anxiety and Behavior Rating Scale and physiological assessments using parameters such as change in heart rate and levels of salivary alpha-amylase as a stress biomarker before and 10 minutes after the procedure. Sociodemographic characteristics, measures of the levels of parent and health care professional satisfaction, occurrence of side effects, and any deviation from normal procedure length will also be collected. Descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests, and effect sizes will be used for demographic and clinical variables and to present parent and health care professional satisfaction levels as well as procedural time. This study will be conducted from May 2023 to May 2024, with results expected to be available in December 2024. The pilot study will provide insight on the feasibility and acceptability of VR use in clinical dentistry to reduce DFA for pediatric patients with SHCN. This study will guide future research on VR use in pediatric dentistry and can serve as a framework for a larger randomized clinical trial.

Newspaper Coverage of Violence Related to Initiation and Traditional Male Circumcision in South Africa.,"This study reports evidence of violence related to initiation and traditional male circumcision (ITMC) in South Africa. Our study conducted a search of the newspaper databases Newsbank and News24 from January 1, 2016, to August 31, 2023, and carried out a content analysis of newspaper articles that referenced violence in South African newspapers. Our initial search yielded 1796 articles; after screening for relevance and duplicates, 41 articles published in 16 South African newspapers and one online source were included in the analysis of the data. Most articles (41%) were published in 2016. Five major types of violence were identified at three unique stages of the ITMC process: (1) bullying; (2) mental and emotional abuse; (3) neglect; (4) physical violence; and (5) gender-based violence. At the pre-initiation stage, the articles reported that boys were forced, abducted, and trafficked into the initiation schools. While at the initiation schools, various forms of bullying, beating, fighting, slapping, assaulting, torturing, burning, neglecting, and physical, mental, and emotional abuse were reported. At the post-initiation stage, physical violence and mental abuse were reported. We noted that some articles reported violence prevention efforts during ITMC. Future research should examine readers' reception of newspaper information about violence associated with ITMC and their awareness of prevention measures. Our findings have implications for public health policy, including the Customary Initiation Act, which provides for the protection of life, the prevention of injuries, and the prevention of all forms of abuse that initiates may be subjected to as a result of initiation practices.",Content analysis;Initiation and traditional male circumcision;Newspaper articles;South Africa;Violence,trauma
Imaging of acute lower limb muscle injury and potential gender differences.,"To assess the most common lower limb acute muscle injuries on MRI imaging in a national specialist centre for orthopaedics and sports medicine and to explore potential gender differences. Over a 3-year time period, all MRI lower limb studies with acute muscle injury (AMI) were reviewed. A British Athletics muscle injury classification (BAMIC) was given and a statistical analysis was performed. A total of 195 AMIs were diagnosed: 177 (91%) male and 18 (9%) female injuries (M to F = 9.8:1). The most common lower limb AMIs were BAMIC grade 1a injuries (n = 48, 25%). The most commonly injured muscle was biceps femoris (n = 87, 45%), specifically grade 1b and grade 2b injuries. There was no significant difference in age between men and women with acute lower limb muscle injuries (p = 0.19). Females were 1.5 times more likely to have a lower grade AMI than males, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.7) owing to a striking lower number of female patients. There was no significant difference between genders in the likelihood of sustaining a hamstring or quadricep AMI (hamstrings OR = 2.47, p = 0.14 and quadriceps OR = 0.926, p 0.99). Grade 1a is the most common lower limb AMI grade in our institution, accounting for 25%. Biceps femoris is the most commonly injured muscle (45%) with grade 1b and grade 2b being the most frequently encountered grades of biceps femoris injuries. Lower-grade injuries are more common in females compared to males, although not significantly so. Further studies are required to explore possible reasons for this gender gap.",Acute muscle injury;British Athletics muscle injury classification;Gender differences,trauma
Are We Jumping to the Wrong Conclusions? Longer Jumps and More Hops in Female Football Players Who Went on to Sustain a Primary or Secondary ACL Injury Compared to Those Who Did Not.,"Different functional performance tests are used to assess patients in the clinic and before return to sport (RTS), where the rehabilitation goal is to reach good strength and jumping ability. A limb symmetry index of ≥ 90% is a common target in rehabilitation before RTS. The aim of this short communication is to use data from our 2-year prospective cohort study on female football players, either with or without an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, to discuss whether hop performance in 3 commonly used hop tests can inform safe football participation, that is, with a low risk for ACL injury or reinjury. At baseline, 117 active female football players (mean age ± standard deviation, 20 ± 2 years) were included 19 ± 9 months after ACL reconstruction as well as 119 matched female knee-healthy players (age 19 ± 3 years). All players performed a single hop for distance test, 5-jump test and side hop test at baseline and were then prospectively followed for 2 years. Twenty-eight (24%) players sustained a second ACL injury and 8 (7%) sustained a primary ACL injury. Longer jumps in the 5-jump test (922 cm vs. 865 cm, Cohen's d =  - 0.60) and more hops in the side hop test for both limbs (41-42 hops vs. 33-36 hops, d =  - 0.43 to - 0.60) were seen in players who sustained a second ACL injury compared with those who did not. Longer jumps in the single hop for distance test (both limbs) (139-140 cm vs. 124-125 cm, d =  - 0.38 to - 0.44), in the 5-jump test (975 cm vs. 903 cm, d = -0.42) and more hops in the side hop test (both limbs) (48-49 hops vs. 37-38 hops, d =  - 0.38 to - 0.47) were seen in players who sustained a primary ACL injury compared with those who did not. The average hop performance, i.e. longer jumps or more hops, was greater in players who went on to sustain a primary or secondary ACL injury compared to those who did not over a two-year follow-up period. Even though hop tests are not used in isolation to evaluate readiness to RTS, their interpretation needs consideration in the decision-making process of returning to pivoting sports.",Performance;Screening;Soccer,trauma
"COVID-19 Vaccination Messengers, Communication Channels, and Messages Trusted Among Black Communities in the USA: a Review.","Black and African American adults exhibited higher levels of mistrust and vaccine hesitancy and lower levels of vaccination throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination and booster uptake remains disproportionately low among Black adults. We conducted a systematic review of empirical research published between February 2021 and July 2022 from five electronic databases and the grey literature. We screened studies that assessed COVID-19 vaccination information needs and preferences as well as communication strategies among Black adults in the USA. We extracted data, then analyzed and synthesized results narratively. Twenty-two articles were included: 2 interventions, 3 experimental surveys, 7 observational surveys, 8 qualitative inquiries, and 2 mixed methods studies. Studies reported credible and preferred COVID-19 vaccination information sources/messengers, channels, and content. Commonly trusted messengers included personal health care providers, social network connections, and church/faith leaders. Electronic outreach (e.g., email, text messages), community events (e.g., forums, canvassing), and social media were popular. Black communities wanted hopeful, fact-based messages that address racism and mistrust; persuasive messages using collective appeals about protecting others may be more influential in changing behavior. Future communication strategies aiming to increase vaccine confidence and encourage COVID-19 booster vaccination among Black communities should be developed in partnership with community leaders and local health care providers to disseminate trauma-informed messages with transparent facts and collective action appeals across multiple in-person and electronic channels.",COVID-19 vaccination;Communication inequalities;Health communication;Systematic review;Vaccine hesitancy,trauma
T Lymphocyte Characteristic Changes Under Serum Cytokine Deviations and Prognostic Factors of COVID-19 in Pregnant Women.,"Physiological changes during pregnancy make the individuals more susceptible to severe respiratory diseases. Hence, pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are likely at a higher risk. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 on T cell response and serum cytokine profile in pregnant patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of women with COVID-19 were collected during the first trimester of pregnancy, and the percentage of total lymphocytes, as well as CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, was assessed using flow cytometry. The expression of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) marker for exhausted T cells was evaluated. Additionally, the serum samples were provided to evaluate the levels of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines, as well as laboratory serological tests. Pregnant women with COVID-19 presented lymphopenia with diminished CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Besides, high expression levels of the PD-1 gene and protein were observed on PBMCs and T cells, respectively, when compared with normal pregnant individuals. Moreover, serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-2 receptor were notably enhanced, while IFN-I α/β values were significantly decreased in the patients when compared with controls. Furthermore, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension were directly correlated with the disease although serum albumin and vitamin D3 levels adversely affected the viral infection. Our study showed extreme lymphopenia and poor T cell response while elevated values of serum inflammatory cytokines in infected pregnant women. Moreover, a hypertension background or metabolic changes, including hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and vitamin D3 or albumin deficiency, might be promising prognostic factors in pregnant women with COVID-19.",COVID-19;Exhausted T cells;PD-1;Pregnancy;SARS-CoV-2,trauma
"Hemodynamic effects of supplemental oxygen versus air in simulated blood loss in healthy volunteers: a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial.","Trauma patients frequently receive supplemental oxygen, but its hemodynamic effects in blood loss are poorly understood. We studied the effects of oxygen on the hemodynamic response and tolerance to simulated blood loss in healthy volunteers. Fifteen healthy volunteers were exposed to simulated blood loss by lower body negative pressure (LBNP) on two separate visits at least 24 h apart. They were randomized to inhale 100% oxygen or medical air on visit 1, while inhaling the other on visit 2. To simulate progressive blood loss LBNP was increased every 3 min in levels of 10 mmHg from 0 to 80 mmHg or until hemodynamic decompensation. Oxygen and air were delivered on a reservoired face mask at 15 L/min. The effect of oxygen compared to air on the changes in cardiac output, stroke volume and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAV) was examined with mixed regression to account for repeated measurements within subjects. The effect of oxygen compared to air on the tolerance to blood loss was measured as the time to hemodynamic decompensation in a shared frailty model. Cardiac output was the primary outcome variable. Oxygen had no statistically significant effect on the changes in cardiac output (0.031 L/min/LBNP level, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.015 to 0.077, P = 0.188), stroke volume (0.39 mL/LBNP level, 95% CI: - 0.39 to 1.2, P = 0.383), or MCAV (0.25 cm/s/LBNP level, 95% CI: - 0.11 to 0.61, P = 0.176). Four subjects exhibited hemodynamic decompensation when inhaling oxygen compared to 10 when inhaling air (proportional hazard ratio 0.24, 95% CI: 0.065 to 0.85, P = 0.027). We found no effect of oxygen compared to air on the changes in cardiac output, stroke volume or MCAV during simulated blood loss in healthy volunteers. However, oxygen had a favorable effect on the tolerance to simulated blood loss with fewer hemodynamic decompensations. Our findings suggest that supplemental oxygen does not adversely affect the hemodynamic response to simulated blood loss.

Safety of immediate open traumatic extensor tendon repair performed at an emergency department minor procedure room.,"The superficial location of the extensor tendons makes them particularly vulnerable to lacerations. Patients most commonly present to the emergency department (ED) after these injuries. We aimed to measure the safety of immediate surgical repair of traumatic open extensor tendon injuries in an ED minor procedure room (MPR) under local anesthesia, and the associated post-operative infection and complication rates. We retrospectively evaluated all patients undergoing traumatic open extensor tendon repairs in the ED MPR over a 3.75-years period. Data collected included demographic information, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, additional procedures performed, and post-operative complications. All patients were operated under local anesthesia by a hand surgery fellow aided by an ED technician. Two hundred and forty eight patients (278 tendons) were treated for extensor tendon injuries during the study period. 220 patients (245 tendons) have complied with follow-up. No intra-procedural medical complications were encountered. The post-operative infection rate was 1.4%. The rate of other post-operative complications was not related to the number of tendons repaired, additional digit involvement, or if the nature of the injury was work-related. In this cohort, traumatic extensor tendon repairs performed in an ED MPR were found to be medically safe and to associate with a low postoperative infection rate. As preoperative assessment is simple and practical, and limited medical personnel is utilized, this surgical setting may enable us to reduce medical costs.",Extensor laceration;Hand injury;Local anesthesia;Minor procedure room;Post-operative infections;Traumatic extensor tendon repair,trauma
[Corrective osteotomies around the knee joint using hexapods].,"Correction of deformities around the knee joint in the frontal and sagittal axis, torsion, length and translation. Complex deformities of the proximal tibia, and to a lesser extent of the distal femur, which cannot be treated with acute correction using plate or nail osteosynthesis. Nicotine abuse, soft tissue problems, lack of patient compliance. First, mounting of the proximal ring of the ring fixator strictly parallel to the joint line in 2 planes, fixation with 3 or 4 pins or wires. Then mounting of the distal ring, fixation also with 3 or 4 wires, connection of both rings with 6 struts (movement units with which the length can be adjusted). Then the fibula osteotomy is performed in the transition from the distal to the middle third, and finally the tibial osteoclasia is performed via a mini-incision as a drill hole chisel osteotomy in the CORA (center of rotation and angulation) of the malposition. Immediately postoperatively, the deformity is defined usimg computer software, the exact position and size of the ring and struts are entered, and a knee image is taken in 2 planes with X‑ray signal adapter (beacon) on the ring fixator to plan the continuous correction. Thereupon continuous correction of the deformity via daily rotation on the 6 struts, which is done by the patients themselves at home after the hospital stay. At the time of correction, pain-adapted partial weight-bearing with 20 kg up to half body weight. After completion of the correction, repeat X‑ray diagnosis and check whether the correction goal has been achieved. If necessary, reprogram a program for renewed continuous correction if residual deformity remains. When the correction goal is reached, X‑ray check. After 6 weeks, with bony consolidation, gradual loading. The treatment of the correction can either be carried out in the ring fixator (wearing time of 0.5-1 year not unusual) or secondarily via a change of procedure to plate osteosynthesis. We report on 25 knee joint corrections in 23 patients (12 women and 11 men) using hexapods (Taylor spatial frame) during the period 2016-2023. One patient had a femoral and a tibial fixator at the same time; another patient had a triple fixator at the tibia. The mean age was 32 (6-73) years. 15 left and 10 right corrections were performed. 19 fixators had been applied tibial, 5 fixators femoral, and 1 fixator cross-jointly (for contracture). The indications were 6 congenital complex deformities, 10 posttraumatic complex deformities, 3 pseudarthroses after correction osteotomies, 2 patients with osteomyelitis, 1 knee contracture and 1 infection after fracture osteosynthesis with nails. The forms of correction performed were varizations and valgizations in frontal axis, extension and flexion in sagittal plane, torsional corrections, lengthening also after acute shortening (pseudarthrosis resection) and segmental transport. Acute shortening without lengthening was also treated with the fixator only until bone healing and a Masqualet procedure was bridged with it. The average duration of fixator wear was 144 (31-443) days. All patients were followed up until final metal removal. There were 19 change of procedure to another osteosynthesis procedure (18 plate osteosynthesis, 1 ESIN); 6 times the treatment in TSF (Taylor Spatial Frame) was performed until final bone healing.",Complex deformity;Continous correction;External fixation;Posttraumatic deformity;Taylor spatial frame,trauma
No difference in return to play rates between different elite sports after primary autograft ACL reconstruction.,"To demonstrate return to play (RTP) rates, the level of RTP and time taken to RTP in different sports after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) and compare the differences between football and rugby. The secondary aims were to compare the differences in intra articular injuries and their treatments and reoperation rates between these sports. A retrospective review of a consecutive series of all primary ACL-R undertaken by the senior author between 2005 and 2019 was undertaken. Patients were included if they were elite athletes and were a minimum of 2 year post-primary autograft ACL-R. The outcomes measured were RTP (defined as participation in a professional match or in national/international-level competition in amateur sports), time to RTP after surgery and RTP level (Tegner score). Three hundred and ninety-four elite athletes, with 420 ACL-Rs were included. 235 (55.9%) were in footballers and 125 (29.8%) were in rugby players. 399 (95.0%) of all elite athletes returned to competition at an average of 10.3 months after ACL-R. 386 (90.2% played at the same or higher level post-surgery. Although there was no difference in RTP rates between different sports, rugby players RTP significantly faster than footballers (9.6 vs 10.6 months, (p = 0.027). Footballers were more likely to rupture their ACL during jumping/landing manoeuvres and to receive a PT graft than rugby players. There were no other significant differences between football and rugby players regarding patient characteristics, intraoperative findings, re-rupture and re-operation rates. Over 95% of all elite athletes RTP after primary ACL-R with 90% able to play at the same level. Rugby players RTP significantly faster than footballers.

[Inpatient surgical treatment in mass casualty situations and disasters-Current treatment capacities depending on alarm status of the hospital and treatment concept].,"The functionality and treatment capacity of hospitals are decisive components to safeguard the in-hospital treatment of patients in crises and catastrophes. This is shown by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The aim of this study is the elicitation of treatment capacities of hospitals in the trauma network of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) assuming a damage situation with a multitude of trauma patients needing treatment. The 622 hospitals in the trauma network were surveyed to elicit the current treatment capacities depending on the principles and standards of treatment. For this purpose, a questionnaire for voluntary participation in the survey was placed online via the Academy of Trauma Surgery (AUC) of the DGU and an electronic platform (SurveyMonkey). The data presented in this article represent an extract of the total data focussed on the issues involved in the study. A total of 252 of the 622 hospitals certified in December 2022 (40%) participated in the survey and 250 datasets could be utilized. Local, regional and supraregional trauma centers were equally represented. Using a tactical abbreviated surgical control (TASC) focussed on survival, the treatment capacities in the individual triage categories could be increased with respect to the scenarios in question. It was also clear that the availability of teams skilled in the surgical treatment of body cavity injuries still represents a challenge. The results of the survey demonstrate the extent to which treatment capacities for the care of injured and wounded patients are currently available in the hospitals of the DGU trauma network and to what extent they can be increased. In this way, due the dynamics a mass casualty incident can initially lead locally and temporarily to a decompensated crisis management. The aim of all efforts and preparations must therefore be to durably strengthen hospitals so that this can be avoided as reliably as possible and to include these considerations in the hospital structural reform.",Body cavity injuries;Certification;Compensated crisis care;Healthcare system;Trauma centers,trauma

The Evolution of Current Concept of the Reconstructive Ladder in Plastic Surgery: The Emerging Role of Translational Medicine.,"Plastic surgeons have used the reconstructive ladder for many decades as a standard directory for complex trauma reconstruction with the goal of repairing body structures and restoring functionality. This consists of different surgical maneuvers, such as secondary intention and direct tissue closure, as well as more complex methods such as local tissue transfer and free flap. The reconstructive ladder represents widely known options achievable for tissue reconstruction and wound closure that puts at the bottom rung the simplest methods of reconstruction and strengthens the complexity by moving upward. Regenerative medicine and surgery constitute a quickly spreading area of translational research that can be employed by minimally invasive surgical strategies, with the aim of regenerating cells and tissues in vivo in order to reestablish normal function through the intrinsic potential of cells, in combination with biomaterials and appropriate biochemical stimuli. These translational procedures have the aim of creating an appropriate microenvironment capable of supporting the physiological cellular function to generate the desired cells or tissues and to generate parenchymal, stromal, and vascular components on demand, and above all to produce intelligent materials capable of determining the fate of cells. Smart technologies have been grown that give extra ""rungs"" on the classic reconstructive ladder to integrate a more holistic, patient-based approach with improved outcomes. This commentary presents the evolution of the traditional concept of the reconstructive ladder in the field of plastic surgery into a new course with the aim of achieving excellent results for soft tissue reconstruction by applying innovative technologies and biologically active molecules for a wide range of surgical diseases.",3D bioprinting;adipose tissue;dermal template;exosomes;reconstructive ladder;reconstructive plastic surgery;reconstructive translational ladder;translational medicine,trauma
"Treatment of Naturally Occurring Tendon Disease with Allogeneic Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: A Randomized, Controlled, Triple-Blinded Pilot Study in Horses.","The treatment of tendinopathies with multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a promising option in equine and human medicine. However, conclusive clinical evidence is lacking. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into clinical treatment efficacy and to identify suitable outcome measures for larger clinical studies. Fifteen horses with early naturally occurring tendon disease were assigned to intralesional treatment with allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs suspended in serum or with serum alone through block randomization (dosage adapted to lesion size). Clinicians and horse owners remained blinded to the treatment during 12 months (seven horses per group) and 18 months (seven MSC-group and five control-group horses) of follow-up including clinical examinations and diagnostic imaging. Clinical inflammation, lameness, and ultrasonography scores improved more over time in the MSC group. The lameness score difference significantly improved in the MSC group compared with the control group after 6 months. In the MSC group, five out of the seven horses were free of re-injuries and back to training until 12 and 18 months. In the control group, three out of the seven horses were free of re-injuries until 12 months. These results suggest that MSCs are effective for the treatment of early-phase tendon disease and provide a basis for a larger controlled study.",MSC;adipose;clinical study;horse serum;mesenchymal progenitor cells;mesenchymal stem cells;re-injury;recurrence rate;tendinopathy;tendon lesion,trauma
Experiences of Impacted Foetal Head: Findings from a Pragmatic Focus Group Study of Mothers and Midwives.,"We aimed to explore the lived experiences of caesarean birth complicated by impaction of the foetal head, for mothers and midwives. A pragmatic, qualitative, focus group study of mixed-participants was conducted, face-to-face. They were postpartum women (n = 4), midwives (n = 4), and a postpartum midwife (n = 1) who had experience of either providing care for impacted foetal head, and/or had experienced it during their own labour, in Fife, United Kingdom. Data were transcribed and were analysed using template analysis. Three main themes emerged through analysis: (i) current knowledge of impacted foetal head; (ii) current management of impacted foetal head; and (iii) experiences and outcomes of impacted foetal head. Each theme was made up of various initial codes when data were analysed inductively. Finally, each theme could be overlaid onto the three core principles of the Tydeman Tube: (1) to improve outcomes for mother and baby in the second stage of labour; (2) to reduce the risk of trauma to mother and baby in complicated births; and (3) to increase respectful care for women in labour; thus allowing for a neat analytic template. A lack of consensus regarding definition, management, and training were highlighted by the midwives. Women anticipated caesarean birth in late labour as straightforward and were therefore unaware of this potential complication. Women and midwives would welcome any new device to facilitate delivery of the impacted foetal head (IFH) as long as it is fully evaluated prior to widespread introduction. Women were not averse to being part of this evaluation process.",birth;complications in birth;complications of labour;impacted foetal head;labour;maternity care;midwives;qualitative research,trauma
Impacts of Climate Change on Work Health and Safety in Australia: A Scoping Literature Review.,"This scoping review explores the extant literature on climate change impacts on Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) in Australia. It maps the coverage of climate hazards, occupations at risk, and health and socio-economic impacts with the aim of identifying climate change impacts on WHS in Australia and associated knowledge gaps. We used a scoping review approach to identify and investigate 41 scholarly works at the nexus between climate change and WHS in Australia. Thematic template analysis and the NVivo software helped us identify and structure the main themes and systematically document the analysis process. The review highlighted a research focus on the impacts on WHS of heat and extreme weather events resulting from climate change. Agriculture and construction emerged as the most examined occupations, emphasising climate-related diseases and productivity loss. Other climate-related hazards, occupations, and health and socio-economic impacts were largely overlooked in the included research literature. The analysis revealed there is scope for further research relating to climate change impacts on occupational hazards (e.g., air pollution), occupations (e.g., indoor settings at risk), worker health (e.g., injuries), and socio-economic impacts (e.g., change in social practice). Furthermore, the results highlight that the main themes (hazards, occupations, health, and productivity) are interconnected, and the impacts of climate change can be 'cascading', adding complexity and severity. Hence, it is important to look at WHS as a multifaceted phenomenon in a holistic way to understand the risks and support required.",Australia;climate change;literature review;work health and safety (WHS);workplace,trauma
The Impact of Psychotrauma and Emotional Stress Vulnerability on Physical and Mental Functioning of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic health condition thought to be influenced by personal life experiences and emotional stress sensitivity (neuroticism). In the present study, we examined the impact of cumulative trauma experiences and trait neuroticism (as a measure for emotional stress vulnerability) on physical and mental functioning of n = 211 patients diagnosed with IBD (112 Crohn's disease, 99 ulcerative colitis). All patients were assessed for self-reported trauma histories, emotional stress vulnerability, clinical disease activity, functional gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and quality of life. Results showed that patients with severe IBD activity have endured significantly more interpersonal trauma and victimization than those with quiescent IBD. Moreover, cumulative trauma was found to exert an indirect (neuroticism-mediated) effect on patients' symptom complexity, with trauma and neuroticism conjointly explaining 16-21% of the variance in gastrointestinal and 35% of the variance in mental symptoms. Upon correction for condition (using a small group of available controls, n = 51), the predictive capacity of trauma and neuroticism increased further, with both predictors now explaining 31% of the somatic-and almost 50% of the mental symptom heterogeneity. In terms of trauma type, victimization (domestic violence and intimate abuse) proved the best predictor of cross-sample symptom variability and the only trauma profile with a consistent direct and indirect (neuroticism-mediated) effect on patients' mental (QoL) and physical fitness. Results are consistent with the growing body of evidence linking experiential vulnerability factors (trauma and neuroticism) and associated feelings of personal ineffectiveness, helplessness, and uncontrollability to interindividual differences in (GI) disease activity and quality of life.",inflammatory bowel disease;neuroticism;trauma;victimization,trauma
Professional Narratives about Older Adults and Health Services Responsive to Fall-Inducing Frailty.,"The second external cause of death from unintentional injuries is falls in people over 60 and is a worldwide Public Health problem. Associated factors are identified early in Primary Health Care. Thus, we analyze professional narratives about older adults/old age and the organization of services in the presence of fall-inducing frailty. A structured narrative was applied under the following stages: understanding the context, setting/plot/character analysis, and interpretive synthesis. Data were collected from August to November 2022, distributing 21 health professionals in three Narrative Focus Groups. In the analyses, the collective conceptions dialogued with Bourdieu's Epistemology of field, habitus, and capital. Technical and common sense representations of older adults were simultaneously observed among the results, along with the belief of old age as a problematic life stage. Care is centered on the installed disease/ailment. Encouraging autonomy and self-care emerges in integrative health practices, which older adults underestimate. Professionals access the lives of older adults according to their habitus, which, in turn, is structured (structuring) in the disputes for installed capital. Thus, the care provided disregards subjectivities and symbolic systems associated with falls.",Primary Health Care;aging;postural balance,trauma
"Association of Active Renin Content With Mortality in Critically Ill Patients: A Post hoc Analysis of the Vitamin C, Thiamine, and Steroids in Sepsis Trial.","Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality. Predicting outcomes is challenging and few biomarkers perform well. Defects in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can predict clinical outcomes in sepsis and may outperform traditional biomarkers. We postulated that RAS dysfunction (elevated active renin, angiotensin 1-7 [Ang-(1-7)], and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity with depressed Ang-II and ACE activity) would be associated with mortality in a cohort of septic patients. Post hoc analysis of patients enrolled in the Vitamin C, Thiamine, and Steroids in Sepsis (VICTAS) randomized controlled trial. Forty-three hospitals across the United States. Biorepository samples of 103 patients. We analyzed day 0 (within 24 hr of respiratory failure, septic shock, or both) and day 3 samples (n = 103 and 95, respectively) for assessment of the RAS. The association of RAS values with 30-day mortality was determined using Cox proportional hazards regression with multivariable adjustments for age, sex, VICTAS treatment arm, systolic blood pressure, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score, and vasopressor use. High baseline active renin values were associated with higher 30-day mortality when dichotomized to the median of 188.7 pg/mL (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.84 [95% CI, 1.10-7.33], p = 0.031) or stratified into quartiles (Q1 = ref, HRQ2 = 2.01 [0.37-11.04], HRQ3 = 3.22 [0.64-16.28], HRQ4 = 5.58 [1.18-26.32], p for linear trend = 0.023). A 1-sd (593.6 pg/mL) increase in renin from day 0 to day 3 was associated with increased mortality (HR = 3.75 [95% CI, 1.94-7.22], p < 0.001), and patients whose renin decreased had improved survival compared with those whose renin increased (HR 0.22 [95% CI, 0.08-0.60], p = 0.003). Ang-(1-7), ACE2 activity, Ang-II and ACE activity did not show this association. Mortality was attenuated in patients with renin over the median on day 0 who received the VICTAS intervention, but not on day 3 (p interaction 0.020 and 0.137, respectively). There were no additional consistent patterns of mortality on the RAS from the VICTAS intervention. Baseline serum active renin levels were strongly associated with mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. Furthermore, a greater relative activation in circulating renin from day 0 to day 3 was associated with a higher risk of death.",,trauma
['Slimmer's paralysis': peroneal neuropathy in anorexia nervosa].,"We describe the development of slimmer&rsquo;s paralysis or &lsquo;foot drop&rsquo; in a patient with anorexia nervosa caused by a transient peroneal nerve injury. This was caused by extreme weight loss in combination with&nbsp;frequently crossing the legs in the context of anorexia nervosa with body image distortion. The most important interventions were weight recovery, physical therapy and avoiding precipitating factors. The relevance of this case lies in the fact that a physical complication of a predominantly mental illness is described. Moreover, this is a possibly lesser-known complication among psychiatrists. This case reminds clinical psychiatrists that mental illness can occur together with somatic complications. It is important to be aware of the possibility of this combination, in order to allow for early intervention and avoid additional injuries. This case also emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary cooperation with respect to&nbsp;mental illness, in particular eating disorders.",,trauma
[Societals costs of trauma].,"Knowing the costs of trauma aids in making informed decisions about investments to prevent and treat trauma. To provide an overview of the potential societal costs of psychological problems caused by traumatic experiences. Using a narrative review based on the available literature on PTSD and adverse childhood events (ACEs), we estimated the possible societal costs for the Netherlands. We used literature on the domains of wellbeing, healthcare, education and labour, crime and justice, and intergenerational transfers. We estimated that costs due to loss of wellbeing may span from tens of millions to several billion euros annually for the Netherlands. Healthcare costs and costs due to lower educational attainment and reduced labor productivity were likely to amount to hundreds of millions of euros annually. Other domains were not quantifiable given current knowledge. Although societal costs cannot completely reliably be determined with current literature, there are reasons to assume that these costs can be significant. Investments in prevention and effective treatment could therefore lead to significant savings.",,trauma
Hemoglobin A1c as a Predictor of Surgical Site Infection in Patients With Orthopaedic Trauma.,"Previous research involving diabetes mellitus (DM), glycemic control, and complications in orthopaedic patients has primarily focused on elective procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate hemoglobin A1c (A1c) as a predictor of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) in patients with orthopaedic trauma. Patients aged 18 years or older treated surgically for an acute fracture by a fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma surgeon at a single academic tertiary referral center with a laboratory value for A1c available within 3 months of their surgery were identified retrospectively. Postoperative SSI was defined according to 'Fracture related infection: A consensus on definition from an international expert group,' by Metsemakers et al. A total of 925 patients met criteria for analysis. A receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated using A1c as a predictor for signs suggestive and confirmatory of SSI and demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.535 and 0.539, respectively. No significant difference was found in the rate of signs suggestive or confirmatory of SSI in patients with normal A1c levels (<6.5) compared with patients with A1c levels consistent with a diagnosis of DM (>6.5), P-value = 0.199 and P-value = 0.297, respectively. No significant difference was found in the rate of signs suggestive or confirmatory of SSI in patients with completely uncontrolled DM (A1c > 10) compared with patients with A1c levels <10, P-value 0.528 and P-value = 0.552, respectively. Existing literature has demonstrated an association with postoperative infection in orthopaedic patients who have elevated A1c values. In this cohort of patients with orthopaedic trauma, hemoglobin A1c was not a valuable tool to predict postoperative SSI. Given these findings, routine A1c monitoring is not a reliable predictor of SSI criteria in patients with orthopaedic trauma based on the current consensus definition of SSI in fracture surgery.",,trauma
On a collision course: fatal motorcycle and bicycle accidents of adolescents in Finland from 2008 to 2019.,"Transport injuries are a major cause of mortality among adolescents. Our aim was to evaluate the circumstances and trauma associated with fatal accidents involving adolescents and two-wheeled vehicles. We analyzed retrospective data from the Finnish Crash Data Institute from 2008 to 2019 involving 10- to 24-year-old victims of fatal traffic accidents who were injured while riding a bicycle, moped or motorcycle. We collected data on patient characteristics, accident circumstances and possible treatment. These fatalities were compared with national mortality rates among the respective age groups. We identified 147 fatalities over the 12-year period involving 20 bicycle, 50 moped and 77 motorcycle riders. Most accidents involved males (n = 121, 82%). Less than half of vehicles were in good condition (46%); motorized vehicles were often illegally tuned (37%) or had tire problems (31%). Most of the accidents were collisions with another vehicle (n = 99, 67%) or other objects (n = 35, 24%). In 94% of cases, the Injury Severity Score was >25. Head injury was the most common cause of death (62%). Among 15-year-olds, every fifth death was due to accidents on two-wheeled vehicles. Fatal transport accidents among adolescents comprise several elements that should be incorporated into driver's education and in case of minors, also communicated to parents. These include the condition of the vehicle, proper helmet use and effects of speed on both control of the vehicle and the consequences of a possible collision.",,trauma
Interaction between posttraumatic stress symptoms and posttraumatic growth among adolescents who experience an earthquake: A repeated longitudinal study.,"For adolescents who experience an earthquake, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) often co-occur. However, no study has yet examined how the interaction between them changes from the short term to the long term after an earthquake. This study conducted six surveys among local adolescents across three waves after the Wenchuan earthquake, and a directed network of PTSS and PTG co-occurrence was constructed for each wave. It was found that the bridge nodes between PTSSs and PTG were different for each wave. The connection between PTSSs and PTG became loose over time. The incubation effect of PTSSs on PTG was sustained until the middle term but was not observed in the long term. The suppression effect of PTSSs on PTG was only observed in the short term. PTG not only alleviated PTSSs but also exacerbated PTSSs. Finally, the effect of PTSSs on PTG was much stronger than that of PTG on PTSSs. This study suggests that efforts should be made to alleviate specific PTSSs or facilitate specific PTG elements among adolescents for different terms after an earthquake, and PTG is more likely to be an outcome of trauma rather than a strategy for coping with trauma.",adolescents;network analysis;posttraumatic growth;posttraumatic stress symptoms,trauma
Augmented and Virtual Reality Applications in Facial Plastic Surgery: A Scoping Review.,"Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are emerging technologies with wide potential applications in health care. We performed a scoping review of the current literature on the application of augmented and VR in the field of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery (FPRS). PubMed and Web of Science. According to PRISMA guidelines, PubMed and Web of Science were used to perform a scoping review of literature regarding the utilization of AR and/or VR relevant to FPRS. Fifty-eight articles spanning 1997-2023 met the criteria for review. Five overarching categories of AR and/or VR applications were identified across the articles: preoperative, intraoperative, training/education, feasibility, and technical. The following clinical areas were identified: burn, craniomaxillofacial surgery (CMF), face transplant, face lift, facial analysis, facial palsy, free flaps, head and neck surgery, injectables, locoregional flaps, mandible reconstruction, mandibuloplasty, microtia, skin cancer, oculoplastic surgery, rhinology, rhinoplasty, and trauma. AR and VR have broad applications in FPRS. AR for surgical navigation may have the most emerging potential in CMF surgery and free flap harvest. VR is useful as distraction analgesia for patients and as an immersive training tool for surgeons. More data on these technologies' direct impact on objective clinical outcomes are still needed.

Factors Associated With Delayed Pre-Hospital Times During Trauma-Related Mass Casualty Incidents: A Systematic Review.,"Critically injured patients have experienced delays in being transported to hospitals during Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs). Extended pre-hospital times (PHTs) are associated with increased mortality. It is not clear which factors affect overall PHT during an MCI. This systematic review aimed to investigate PHTs in trauma-related MCIs and identify factors associated with delays for triaged patients at incident scenes. This systematic review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched between January and February 2022 for evidence. Research studies of any methodology, and grey literature in English, were eligible for inclusion. Studies were narratively synthesized according to Cochrane guidance. Of the 2025 publications identified from the initial search, 12 papers met the inclusion criteria. 6 observational cohort studies and 6 case reports described a diverse range of MCIs. PHTs were reported variably across incidents, from a median of 35 minutes to 8 hours, 8 minutes. Factors associated with prolonged PHT included: challenging incident locations, concerns about scene safety, and adverse decision-making in MCI triage responses. Casualty numbers did not consistently influence PHTs. Study quality was rated moderate to high. PHT delays of more than 2 hours were common. Future MCI planning should consider responses within challenging environments and enhanced timely triage decision-making.",delay;mass casualty incident;pre-hospital time;trauma;triage,trauma
From Holocaust to Anfal: The impact of genocide and cross-generational trauma on the mental health of Kurds.,"Genocide attempts are among the most severe traumatic events that are transmitted across generations. However, it may also prove the strength and survivability as well as the vulnerability of the targeted group. Anfal and chemical attacks on Halabja on Iraqi Kurds that targeted their annihilation had a devastating impact. Many survivors and their generations are still dealing with their effects on psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. To address the psychological effects of these tragic events on survivors and their generations and propose the actions to be taken, this article explores the psychological trauma and problems caused by attempted genocide and chemical attacks in the case of Anfal campaign. These effects require more research to fully understand the long-term effects of these tragedies, as well as support and provision of comprehensive psychological and mental health interventions to their survivors and generations.",Anfal campaign;Halabja;Kurds;genocide;trauma,trauma
Developing a research tool to detect iatrogenic adverse events in psychiatric health care by involving service users and health professionals.,"Most health professionals working in psychiatric care will experience adverse events (AE) such as service user suicide or violence, during their career Norway lacks measures to capture potential iatrogenic injuries, such as risk assessment measures, to evaluate patient records for AEs in both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric clinics in hospitals WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: We have described an approach to the validation of a research tool between different national contexts; a process that went beyond language translation We have incorporated the understanding of health professionals and service users; to bring together the lifeworld of the patient with the professional definition of AEs, triggers and risk areas of AEs in a psychiatric context. The service users' experiences resulted in modifications to the tool. Applying the 'Global Trigger Tool-Psychiatry' in Norway and Sweden can help mental health nurses to prevent iatrogenic harm and reduce the occurrence of AEs through the identification of potential triggers. Implementing 'Global Trigger Tool-Psychiatry' might help mental health nurses to improve patient safety in Norway and Sweden. INTRODUCTION: There is little consensus on cross-cultural and cross-national adaptation of research instruments. To translate and validate a Swedish research tool (GTT-P) to detect iatrogenic adverse events in psychiatric health care by involving service users and health professionals in the process. The GTT-P, designed to identify events in patient records that were triggers for adverse events, was translated to Norwegian using a cross-cultural adaptation approach. This involved two focus groups with clinical staff, one of which involved service users, and a joint discussion at a Dialogue Conference to generate consensus on the definition of the triggers of potential adverse events identifiable in patient records. We highlight both the differences and commonalities in defining the nature of risks, the adverse events and the triggers of such events. The Dialogue Conference resulted in three modifications of the tool, based on service users' experiences. Service user involvement and co-production was essential for both the translation and adaptation of the research instrument. We have described an approach to the validation of a research tool between different national contexts; a process that went beyond language translation. This approach enables a more nuanced understanding of potential risks within a psychiatric context as it engages differences in the care delivery. Applying the GTT-P in hospital-based psychiatric care might help to identify processes that need to be changed in order to promote patient safety and a safer work environment for mental health nurses. When translating and validating the GTT-P from Swedish to Norwegian, we have considered the knowledge and experiences of both service users and health professionals. The application of the GTT-P can promote greater patient safety in hospital settings.",Global Trigger Tool;adverse event;patient involvement;patient safety;psychiatry,trauma
Posttraumatic stress and delay discounting: a meta-analytic review.,"Delay discounting-the extent to which individuals show a preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards-has been proposed as a transdiagnostic neurocognitive process across mental health conditions, but its examination in relation to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is comparatively recent. To assess the aggregated evidence for elevated delay discounting in relation to posttraumatic stress, we conducted a meta-analysis on existing empirical literature. Bibliographic searches identified 209 candidate articles, of which 13 articles with 14 independent effect sizes were eligible for meta-analysis, reflecting a combined sample size of N = 6897. Individual study designs included case-control (e.g. examination of differences in delay discounting between individuals with and without PTSD) and continuous association studies (e.g. relationship between posttraumatic stress symptom severity and delay discounting). In a combined analysis of all studies, the overall relationship was a small but statistically significant positive association between posttraumatic stress and delay discounting (r = .135, p < .0001). The same relationship was statistically significant for continuous association studies (r = .092, p = .027) and case-control designs (r = .179, p < .001). Evidence of publication bias was minimal. The included studies were limited in that many did not concurrently incorporate other psychiatric conditions in the analyses, leaving the specificity of the relationship to posttraumatic stress less clear. Nonetheless, these findings are broadly consistent with previous meta-analyses of delayed reward discounting in relation to other mental health conditions and provide further evidence for the transdiagnostic utility of this construct.",PTSD;behavioral economics;delayed reward discounting;impulsivity;intertemporal choice;meta-analysis;posttraumatic stress disorder;systematic review;trauma,trauma
Road traffic injuries and associated mortality in the Islamic Republic of Iran.,"Road traffic accidents are a major public health problem globally, causing millions of injuries, deaths and disabilities, and a huge loss of financial resources, especially in low- and middle-income countries. To determine the incidence of road traffic injuries and associated mortality from 1997 to 2020 in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This retrospective study used data from the Legal Medicine Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran to estimate the annual rates of road traffic injuries and associated mortality from 21 March 1997 to 20 March 2020. The data were analysed using STATA version 14 and the annual rates are reported per 100 000 population. During the study period, 5 760 835 road traffic injuries and 472 193 deaths were recorded in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The mortality rate increased from 22.4 per 100 000 in 1997 to 40 per 100 000 in 2005 and decreased to 18.4 per 100 000 in 2020. The injury rate increased from 111.1 per 100 000 in 1997 to 394.9 per 100 000 in 2005. It decreased in 2006 and 2007 and increased from then until 2010, finally reaching 331.8 per 100 000 in 2020. The male to female ratio for road traffic mortality was 3.9 in 1997 and 4.6 in 2020. The case fatality rate was highest (20.1%) in 1997 and decreased to 5.6% in 2020. Continuous interventions are needed to reduce the burden of road traffic injuries and associated mortality in the Islamic Republic of Iran.",Islamic Republic of Iran;road traffic accidents;road traffic deaths;road traffic injuries,trauma
"Can psychopathy be prevented? Clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic data: an exploratory study.","The aim of the study was to explore the relationship among brain functional activations elicited by an emotional paradigm, clinical scores (PTSD, anxiety, and depression), psychopathic traits, and genetic characteristics (5-HTTLPR) in a group of severely maltreated children compared to a healthy control group before and after the implementation of a Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. The final sample consisted of an experimental group of 14 maltreated children (mean age = 8.77 years old, S.D. = 1.83) recruited from a non-governmental shelter in Mexico City for children who had experienced child abuse and a control group of 10 children from the general population (mean age = 9.57 years old, S.D. = 1.91). Both groups were matched according to age and gender and were assessed before and after the implementation of the aforementioned therapy by means of clinical scales and an emotional paradigm that elicited brain activations which were recorded through functional magnetic resonance imaging. Genotyping of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was made at first assessment. A region of interest analysis showed amygdala hyperactivation during exposure to fear and anger stimuli in the maltreated children before treatment. Following therapy, a decrease in brain activity as well as a decrease in clinical symptoms were also observed. 5-HTTLPR polymorphism did not show any effect on the severity of clinical symptoms in maltreated children. Trauma-Focused Behavioral Therapy may help reorganize the brain's processing of emotional stimuli. These observations reveal the importance of an early intervention when the mechanisms of neuroplasticity may be still recruited.",Childhood maltreatment;brain reorganization;fMRI;neurodevelopmental psychopathy;post-traumatic stress disorder,trauma
Pediatric Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.,"The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in children and adolescents has been growing recently. This problem is a challenge for the treating orthopedic surgeon, especially when the patient is in the prepubertal period with a high growth potential. Since reconstructive procedures require interventions close to active growth plates, they are associated with the risk of postoperative limb length discrepancies and limb deformities. Postponing ACL reconstruction until the end of growth is not a solution, as persistent knee instability increases the risk of secondary intra-articular damage. The key to success is not only knowledge of the anatomy and biomechanics of the pediatric knee but also the ability to predict the remaining growth potential and familiarity with a wide range of reconstructive surgical procedures available for patients at different ages.",children;cruciate ligaments;knee joint;surgery,trauma
Long Versus Short-segment Stabilization in Patients with Traumatic Thoracolumbar Fractures.,"Posterior stabilization surgery is considered the gold standard for restoring spine stability in patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. However, whether long-segment (LS) stabilization or short-segment (SS) stabilization is an optimal approach for achieving more effective restoration of spinal stability remains unclear. Patients who underwent posterior stabilization surgery for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures were included in the study. Radiological parameters were measured using pre- and post-surgical thoracolumbar computed tomography (CT) scans and compared between patients who received LS and SS stabilization. Ninety-eight consecutive patients (mean age 4414, 50% male) who underwent posterior stabilization surgery for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures were included. LS stabilization was performed in 52 patients, while SS stabilization was performed in 46 patients. Among spinal stability parameters measured on pre-surgical thoracolumbar CT scans, the anterior vertebral height (AVH) was significantly lower in the LS stabilization group compared to the SS stabilization group (14.44.0 mm vs. 16.44.0 mm, p=0.017), indicating a more severe compression fracture in the LS stabilization group. However, all parameters improved on post-surgical thoracolumbar CT scans, and there were no significant differences between LS stabilization and SS stabilization groups in terms of the restoration of spinal stability parameters. The type of stabilization (LS vs. SS stabilization) did not show an association with post-surgical measurements of spinal stability parameters (B=0.27, 95% CI -1.87 to 2.42, p=0.800 for superior inferior end plate angle (SIEA), B=0.20, 95% CI -1.33 to 1.74, p=0.796 for AVH, and B=0.39, 95% CI -1.72 to 2.50, p=0.714 for Cobb angle). Both LS and SS stabilization approaches yield similar results in terms of restoring spine stability parameters in patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. The choice of surgical approach should be individualized based on the patient's overall status and the surgeon's experience.",long-segment stabilization;posterior stabilization surgery;short-segment stabilization;traumatic spine fracture,trauma
Current Status of β-Thalassemic Burden in India.,"Thalassemia is a major public health concern in India. The thalassemic burden in India is high, with an estimated 100,000 patients diagnosed with β-thalassemia syndrome. However, the exact number is unknown because of the absence of National Registries for patients. India alone contributes to approximately 25% of the global β-thalassemia burden. A possible option to control this burden is to endorse education and awareness programs, compulsory prenatal screening, and develop suitable facilities for genetic counseling, and availability of cost-effective diagnostic tests in India, especially in rural areas. In addition to the various clinical complications associated with thalassemia, lifelong intervention creates mental and physical trauma in patients and their relatives. Government and nongovernment organizations have initiated screening programs to prevent thalassemia. However, prenatal screening is not mandatory, and the reachability of screening programs in rural areas is yet to begin. This review article will discuss the progress in thalassemia research in India, including its prevalence, spectrum of β-thalassemia mutations, preventive and therapeutic measures, and awareness programs. More importantly, we will discuss the need and roadmap to strengthen prevention programs in India.",hemoglobin;preventive strategies;therapeutic strategies;β-Thalassemia,trauma

The Family Context in Cybervictimization: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The use of Information and Communication Technologies is clearly widespread among adolescents from a young age. Although it poses a significant contribution at the academic, social, and emotional levels, it can also involve a set of important risks, including cyberbullying and, therefore, cybervictimization. Previous studies have pointed out the importance of family context since parental control and family communication emerge as contributors to this phenomenon. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of family communication on cybervictims and the moderating role of different sociodemographic variables (age, gender, nationality, and culture), as well as social, emotional, and personality variables. In this context, a meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model, using a total meta-sample of 29,093 adolescents (mean age: 14.50 years) distributed in k = 20 samples belonging to nine studies on cybervictimization published in English in Q1 journals between 2015 and 2020. The results showed that family offensive communication is related to cybervictimization. This could be because the affected individuals often use social media to compensate for the deficiencies they perceive within their families, as well as to obtain support, which increases their time spent on the Internet and their exposure to this phenomenon. These findings highlight the need for family and community interventions, not only school-based or individual interventions.",Internet and abuse;bullying;community violence;cyberaggression;family issues and mediators;youth violence,trauma
A Scoping Review of Parenting Programs for Preventing Violence Against Children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,"Violence against children affects their well-being globally, with a greater burden in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This scoping review aimed to summarize the available evidence on parenting programs for reducing violence against children in LMICs and identify knowledge gaps in this area. Six English databases and gray literature were systematically searched to identify studies in LMICs that examined the efficacy of parenting programs to prevent violence against children, before April 15, 2023. A total of 4,183 independent studies were identified, of which 31 met the inclusion criteria. The majority were conducted in Africa and Asia, delivered by trained local community/childcare workers and lay workers, and targeted younger children aged <10 years. Although the core modules varied in terms of number of group sessions and age of the children, the majority emphasized the importance of building a positive relationship with children and nonviolent discipline strategies. The vast majority demonstrated intervention efficacy in reducing general maltreatment and physical and emotional abuse, and improving positive parenting. Ineffective programs for violence tended to be characterized by self-designed programs, small sample sizes, and low corporal punishment levels in the baseline assessment. In conclusion, parenting programs are promising for preventing and reducing the risk factors for violence in LMICs. Future intervention studies should expand to low-income countries outside Eastern Africa with more trials targeting older children, utilizing direct observational assessments, designing core modules relevant to child neglect, involving more male caregivers, and conducting long-term follow-up assessments.",child abuse;child maltreatment;low-and-middle-income countries;parenting programs;prevention;violence against children,trauma
Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogels for in Situ Programming of Car-T Cells Towards Solid Tumor Immunotherapy.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapy has been approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, but remains far from satisfaction in solid tumor treatment due to inadequate intra-tumor CAR-T cell infiltration. Herein, an injectable supramolecular hydrogel system, based on self-assembly between cationic polymer mPEG-PCL-PEI (PPP) conjugated with T cell targeting anti-CD3e f(ab')2 fragment and α-cyclodextrin (α-CD), has been designed to load plasmid CAR (pCAR) with T cell specific CD2 promoter, which successfully achieved in situ fabrication and effective accumulation of CAR-T cells at the tumor site in humanized mice models. More importantly, due to this tumor microenvironment reprogramming, secretion of cellular inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) or tumor killer protein granzyme B was significantly promoted, which reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment and significantly enhanced the intra-tumor CAR-T cells and cytotoxic T cells infiltration. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer report of using injectable supramolecular hydrogel for in situ reprogramming CAR-T cells, which might be beneficial for solid tumor CAR-T immunotherapy.

Clinical Outcomes and Associated Pathologies Following Pediatric Traumatic Hip Dislocations: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"Pediatric traumatic hip dislocations are a rare condition that can have devastating short and/or long-term outcomes and associated pathologies (APs), including associated injuries (AIs) and long-term adverse events (LTAEs), with negative long-term sequelae. Currently, there are little data that exist on the rate of APs, with the most notable being avascular necrosis (AVN), for pediatric traumatic hip dislocations. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the outcome relative frequency of dislocation direction, reduction type, and rate of APs for traumatic hip dislocations in the pediatric population. A systematic review on the topic of traumatic hip dislocations in the pediatric population was performed using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, CINAHL, and MEDLINE databases from database inception to March 30, 2023. Inclusion criteria was full-text English articles, addressed traumatic hip dislocations, and pediatric patients (<18 y old). A total of 24 articles (n=575 patients) met final inclusion criteria from a total of 219 articles retrieved from the initial search. For the average age of the included patients with reported age (n=433 patients), the frequency weighted mean was 9.50 years±1.75 years with a frequency weighted mean follow-up time of 74.05 months ±45.97 months (n=399 patients). The most common dislocation direction was posterior (86.4%), the most common treatment type was closed reduction (84.5%), AVN was the most common type of LTAEs (15.5% of APs), and labral/capsular injuries and acetabular fractures were the most common type of AIs (14.0% and 9.4% of APs, respectively). There were a combined total of 414 APs (72%) out of 575 total patients. Pediatric traumatic hip dislocations are associated with a high rate of AIs and LTAEs (72%, 414 APs out of 575 patients). AVN, labral/capsular injuries, and acetabular fractures are the most common APs after pediatric traumatic hip dislocations. Pediatric hip dislocations are usually posterior and commonly managed through closed reduction. III, Systematic Review.",,trauma
The perceived value of a geriatrics-surgery co-management program: Perspectives from three surgical specialties.,"Geriatrics-surgery co-management (GSCM) programs have improved patient outcomes, but little is known about how they change care and whether their value varies by surgical specialty. We aimed to assess GSCM's effects as perceived by Orthopedic Trauma, Trauma, and Neurosurgery clinicians. We conducted a mixed-methods study utilizing electronic survey and virtual interviews at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, an academic trauma center, in Philadelphia, PA. Participants included physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, social workers, and case managers in the aforementioned specialties. Key measures were perspectives on value of GSCM, its facilitators, specialty most appropriate to manage specified medical issues, and factors affecting use. Of 71 eligible clinicians, 45 (63%) completed the survey and 12 (21%) of 56 purposefully sampled for specialty-role diversity were interviewed. Clinicians across specialties valued GSCM highly and similarly for impact on personal management of older adults (grand mean [standard error, SE] = 4.33 [0.24] out of 5; p = 0.80 for specialty means comparisons), patient care (mean [SE] = 4.47 [0.21]; p = 0.27), patient outcomes (mean [SE] = 4.26 [0.22]; p = 0.51), and specialty overall (mean [SE] = 4.55 [0.23]; p = 0.25) but less so for knowledge growth (mean [SE] = 3.47 [0.29]; p = 0.11). Interviewees across specialties reported that value derived from improved understanding of patient history, management of complex medical conditions, goals of care support, communication with families, and patient discharge facilitation. Interviewees also agreed on program facilitators: aligned stakeholders, shared data-driven goals, champion/administrative support, continuity and availability of geriatricians, and thorough communication. Specialties differed on three issues: (1) who should manage some medical concerns; (2) whether GSCM makes their job easier (significantly easier for Orthopedic Trauma: mean [SE] = 4.75 [0.29] vs. Trauma: mean [SE] = 4.01 [0.19]; p = 0.05); and (3) whether GSCM increases coordination difficulty (more for Neurosurgery: mean [SE] = 2.18 [0.0.58] vs. Orthopedic Trauma: mean [SE] = 0.51 [0.42]; p = 0.03 and Trauma: mean [SE] = 0.89 [0.28]; p = 0.07). Orthopedic Trauma had the most positive impression of GSCM overall. Clinicians across diverse surgical specialties valued GSCM. Hospitals considering implementation or expansion of GSCM should attend to identified facilitators and may need to tailor to specialty.",co-management;geriatrics;surgery,trauma

Aggressive angiomyxoma of the epididymis: A case report.,"Aggressive angiomyolipoma is an extremely rare benign mesenchymal tumor that was originally described as a locally recurrent mucinous spindle cell tumour. Aggressive angiomyolipoma originates from myofibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, or fibroblasts, and displays various phenotypes of myofibroblasts and abnormal muscle arteries. Aggressive angiomyolipoma was first identified in 1983 and fewer than 50 male patients have been reported to date. It is an extremely rare mesenchymal tumour and often confused with other diseases. Patients with epididymal aggressive angiomyolipoma lack typical symptoms, most of which occur incidentally, although some patients may experience mild pain, discomfort, and swelling. Pain may be exacerbated by pressure from the mass. A 66-year-old male was admitted to the hospital on January 14, 2022 with chief complaint of swelling in the left scrotum for one year. There was no apparent cause for the swelling. The patient did not consult with any doctor or receive any treatment for the swelling. The enlarged scrotum increased in size gradually until it reached approximately the size of a goose egg, and was accompanied by discomfort and swelling of the left cavity of the scrotum. The patient had no history of any testicular trauma, infection, or urinary tract infection. The patient urinated freely, 1-2 times at night, without urgency, dysuria (painful urination), or haematuria. There was no significant family history of malignancy. The patient underwent excision of the enlarged tumour and the left epididymis under general anaesthesia on January 18, 2022. Twelve months of follow-up revealed no recurrence. The patient was satisfied with the treatment. Aggressive angiomyolipoma is extremely rare clinically and often confused with other diseases. The pathogenesis of aggressive angiomyolipoma is unclear and the clinical presentation is mostly a painless enlarged mass. The diagnosis of aggressive angiomyolipoma requires a combination of medical history, preoperative imaging such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, cytological examination and preoperative and postoperative pathological biopsy. The preferred treatment is surgery, with the possibility of a new alternative treatment option after hormonal therapy. Aggressive angiomyolipoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of parametrial tumors of the male genital area that present as clinically significant masses. The high recurrence rate of aggressive angiomyolipoma may be related to incomplete tumor resection, and patients with aggressive angiomyolipoma are advised to undergo annual postoperative follow-up and imaging for recurrence.",Aggressive angiomyxoma;Case report;Epididymal malignancy;Male reproductive system neoplasms;Mesenchymal tumor;Orchiectomy;Scrotal mass,trauma
"Associations between child abuse and neglect, and dento-alveolar injuries in a Children's hospital population.","The purpose of this study was to identify social variables common to children with dento-alveolar trauma (DAT) and child abuse and neglect (CAN) in a large children's hospital population. Emergency department data from an urban trauma Level 1 children's hospital were queried between December 02, 2017 and September 30, 2022 to identify children with both DAT and CAN. Patients with DAT and CAN were compared to DAT-only children in a case-control study design. Descriptive statistics were used to report characteristics of children in case and control groups. Chi-Squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare cases and controls. The level of significance was set at p ≤ .05. In total, 14 children who had DAT and CAN reported simultaneously comprised the case group. A total of 42 children with DAT-only, age/sex matched with cases, comprised the control group. Mean (SD) age of cases was 10.4 (±4) and controls was 10.1 (±3.9) years-old. Eight cases (57.1%) and 24 controls (57.1%) were female. No statistical differences (p = .05) were present for language, race, insurance coverage, parental custody, legal guardianship, and type of residence for cases versus controls. Five (35.7%) cases had a special need versus 4 (9.5%) controls and was statistically different (p = .03). Nine (64.3%) cases had behavioral problems versus 13 (31%) controls (p = .05). Cases were more likely to have facial injuries than controls (74.3 vs. 31%), however no significant differences were present for total number of injured teeth, head injury or neck injury between cases and controls. In half of cases, the perpetrator reported was the sibling. Demographics did not predict CAN in children with dental injuries. Sibling violence should be considered in suspected CAN children.",child abuse;dental trauma;dento-alveolar trauma;injury;neglect,trauma
Sprayable self-assembly multifunctional bioactive poly(ferulic acid) hydrogel for rapid MRSA infected wound repair.,"The repair of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infected wounds remains a serious challenge. Development of multifunctional bioactive hydrogels has shown promising potential in treating MRSA wound. Ferulic acid has special bioactivities including antioxidant antiinflammation antibacterial capacities but limited in lack of engineering strategy for efficient treatment of MRSA infected wound. Herein, we developed a multifunctional bioactive poly(ferulic acid) copolymer (FPFA) for treating MRSA infected wound. FPFA could be self-assembled into hydrogel under body temperature and demonstrated the injectable, sprayable, self-healing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and angiogenic activity. FPFA hydrogel also showed the good cytocompatibility, efficiently enhanced the endothelial cell migration, scavenged intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors and enhanced the in vitro angiogenesis. The MRSA-infected wound model showed that FPFA could significantly inhibit the MRSA infection and excess inflammation, reinforce the angiogenesis, accelerate wound healing and skin tissue regeneration.",bioactive materials;multifunctional bioactivity;tissue engineering;wound repair,trauma

In this setting, a DRUJ capsular release may help improve forearm rotation, but the long-term functional outcomes remain unknown. The purpose of this case series is to investigate the short-term improvement in total pronosupination arc range of motion and long-term patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after DRUJ capsular release. We performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent DRUJ capsular release. Range of motion prior to surgery and at final short-term follow-up was collected and analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Patient-reported outcomes including QuickDASH and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity (UE) scores were obtained as medians with interquartile range (IQR), while patient satisfaction was measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Five patients met the inclusion criteria with a median short-term follow-up of 5.5 (IQR: 4.3-10.3) months. The median preoperative supination was 25° (IQR: 0°-35°), and the median postoperative supination was 50° (IQR: 40°-60°; P = .03). The median preoperative pronation was 45° (IQR: 10°-60°), and the median postoperative pronation was 70° (IQR: 60°-80°; P = .04). After the long-term median follow-up of 10.9 (IQR 9.7-11.2) years, all the patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the results of the surgery. The median QuickDASH score was 13.6 (IQR: 9.1-20.5), and the median PROMIS UE score was 46.5 (IQR: 43.8-47.7). Distal radioulnar joint capsular release can improve pronation and supination in patients with posttraumatic forearm stiffness and is associated with high long-term patient satisfaction.",DRUJ;capsule release;diagnosis;distal radius;forearm stiffness;fracture/dislocation;range of motion,trauma
Acute and Chronic Effects of Blood Flow Restriction Training in Physically Active Patients With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review.,"Muscle atrophy and loss of knee function are common findings after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Rehabilitation through blood flow restriction (BFR) has gained clinical relevance when combined with low loads to improve these disorders in recent years. To evaluate the rehabilitation effectiveness of ACL reconstruction with the use of BFR on pain, functionality, strength, and muscle mass in physically active people. A search of PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE was performed on March 31, 2023, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Randomized clinical trials with active adults who underwent ACL surgery were included. They had to compare conventional treatments with the use of BFR, reporting values of pain, functionality, strength, or cross-sectional area (CSA). Articles whose participants presented concomitant injuries and whose intervention combined the use of BFR with treatments other than resistance training were excluded. Systematic review. Level 2. Study design, population, cuff pressure, and main outcomes including strength, quadriceps CSA, pain, and functionality. Six studies out of a total of 389 were included (152 participants; 90 men and 62 women). These included studies showed no differences on CSA or strength when comparing BFR training with high loads exercise. BFR has demonstrated improvements in knee functionality and pain compared with other interventions such as immobilization or high loads training. The use of low loads combined with BFR improves pain, strength, functionality, and CSA. In addition, knee pain reduction and functionality are greater with BFR compared with the use of high loads or immobilization.",anterior cruciate ligament;blood flow restriction;kaatsu;occlusive training;rehabilitation,trauma
Parent-Child Communication About Potentially Traumatic Events: A Systematic Review.,"Social support plays an important role in children's well-being after experiencing a potentially traumatic event (PTE). One such source of support is the parent-child relationship, specifically by discussing the event. However, current literature provides no consensus on whether parents and children communicate about PTEs, in what way they might communicate and how this affects the child. Hence the goal of the current study is threefold, to explore: (a) whether parents and children communicate about PTEs, (b) what this communication looks like, and (c) how this affects children's well-being. These questions are answered by means of a systematic literature review. Articles were eligible for inclusion if it was an empirical study on communication between parents and children about a PTE that the child (under 18 years) had experienced. Initial searches in electronic databases provided 31,233 articles, of which 26 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Results show that most parents and children have discussed PTEs, but that this may depend on cultural background. What the parent-child communication looks like depends on various factors such as, age of the child, tone, and child's initiation of discussion. Parental post-traumatic stress symptoms seem to negatively impact communication. The results of the impact of communication are less clear-cut, but it seems to have a predominantly positive effect on the child's well-being, depending on parental sensitivity. Clinicians should be watchful for parental symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and can focus on promoting parental sensitivity and responsiveness when discussing PTEs with their child or on creating a joint narrative within families.",PTSD;attachment;child abuse;cultural contexts;reporting/disclosure;sexual assault;support seeking;treatment/intervention,trauma
Risk of Tendon Injury in Patients Treated With Fluoroquinolone (FQ) Versus Non-Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).,"Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are associated with increased risk of tendon injury but comparative risk versus other antibiotic options for the same indication has yet to be evaluated. Describe the incidence (relative risk) of any tendon injury in patients receiving FQ compared with other (non-FQs) antibiotics for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A retrospective propensity score weighted cohort study was performed to evaluate the association between FQ antibiotics and tendon injury risk at 2 time points (within 1 month and within 6 months of use) compared with non-FQ regimens for treatment of CAP. The evaluation was performed using the CCAE (MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters) and COB (Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits) databases from 2014 to 2020. Patients with ICD (International Classification of Diseases) 9/10 coding for outpatient pneumonia who were >18 years and without history of tendon injury were included. Patients with history of tendon injury, who received multiple antibiotic therapies for recurrent pneumonia, or who received both FQ and non-FQ regimens during the study period were excluded. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for selection bias due to contributing risk factors, including demographics (age, sex), comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease), and concurrent medications (corticosteroids). At 1 month, the odds of tendon injury were estimated to be significantly higher (41.9%) in patients receiving FQs compared with those receiving a non-FQ-based regimen (odds ratio [OR] = 1.419, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.188-1.698]). The odds of tendon injury were also estimated to be higher (OR = 1.067, 95% CI = [0.975-1.173]) in the FQ population within 180 days, but this effect was not statistically significant. The most frequent sites of tendon injuries were rotator cuff, shoulder, and patellar tendon. Prescribers should recognize the risk of tendon injury within 1 month of FQ use when considering treatment regimens for CAP and use alternative options with lower risk whenever possible.",community-acquired pneumonia;fluoroquinolone;tendon injury,trauma
Preoperative Radiographic Simulation for Partial Uncinate Process Resection during Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion to Achieve Adequate Foraminal Decompression and Prevention of Vertebral Artery Injury.,"Retrospective radiographic study. This study aims to demonstrate the proper resection trajectory of a partial posterior uncinate process resection combined with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and evaluate whether foraminal stenosis or uncinate process degeneration increases the risk of vertebral artery (VA) injury. Appropriate resection trajectory that could result in sufficient decompression and avoid vertebral artery injury is yet unknown. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent cervical magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography for preoperative ACDF evaluation. The segments were classified according to the presence of foraminal stenosis. The height, thickness, anteroposterior length, horizontal distance from the uncinate process to the VA, and vertical distance from the uncinate process baseline to the VA of the uncinate process were measured. The distance between the uncinate anterior margin and the resection trajectory (UAM-to-RT) was measured. There were no VA injuries or root injuries among the 101 patients who underwent ACDF (163 segments, mean age of 56.3±12.2). Uncinate anteroposterior length was considerably longer in foramens with foraminal stenosis, whereas uncinate process height, thickness, and distance between the uncinate process and VA were not significantly associated with foraminal stenosis. There were no significant differences in radiographic parameters based on uncinate degeneration. The UAM-to-RT distances for adequate decompression were 1.6±1.4 mm (range, 0-4.8 mm), 3.4±1.7 mm (range, 0-7.1 mm), 4.0±1.7 mm (range, 0-9.0 mm), and 4.5±1.2 mm (range, 2.5-7.5 mm) for C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7, respectively. More than half of the uncinate process in the anteroposterior plane should be removed for adequate neural foramen decompression. Foraminal stenosis or uncinate degeneration did not alter the relative anatomy of the uncinate process and the VA and did not impact VA injury risk.",Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion;Cervical radiculopathy;Foraminal stenosis;Foraminotomy;Resection trajectory;Uncinate process resection;Vertebral artery injury,trauma
"Spinal Deformity, Surgery at the Cervicothoracic Junction, and American Society of Anesthesiologists Class Increase the Risk of Post-surgical Intensive Care Unit Treatment after Dorsal Spine Surgery: A Single-Center Multivariate Analysis of 962 Patients.","This was a retrospective multivariate analysis of preoperative risk factors leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in patients undergoing elective or acute dorsal spine surgery. Numerous studies have predicted a substantial increase in spine surgeries within the next decades, potentially overwhelming hospitals' resources, including ICU occupancy. Accurate estimates of whether patients need postsurgical ICU treatment are pivotal for both resource allocation and patient safety. Risk factors leading to ICU admissions after dorsal spine surgery have been extensively examined for lumbar elective surgery. Studies including other anatomical segments of the spine and nonelective surgery regarding postsurgical ICU treatment probability are lacking. This study was designed to be a single-center multivariate analysis of data retrospectively collected from a tertiary care university hospital. Patients undergoing dorsal spine surgery from 2009 to 2019 were included in this study. The patients' demographic data were analyzed to determine potential preoperative risk factors for ICU admission after surgery using multiple logistic regression. In our cohort, 962 patients with a mean age of 71.1±0.55 years were included. Surgeries involved 3.24±0.08 spinal levels on average. The incidence of ICU treatment after surgery was 30.4% (n=292). Multivariate logistic regression showed a markedly increased odds ratio (OR) for patients undergoing surgery of the cervicothoracic junction (OR, 8.86) and those undergoing surgery for spinal deformity treatment (OR, 7.7). Additionally, cervical procedures (OR, 3.29), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 3-4 (OR, 2.74), spondylodiscitis (OR, 2.47), fusion of ≥3 levels (OR, 1.94), and age >75 years (OR, 1.33) were associated with an increased risk of postsurgical ICU admission. The findings highlight the relevance of anatomical location, preoperative diagnosis, ASA class, and length of surgery regarding the predictability of postoperative ICU admission. Our data allowed for more sophisticated estimates regarding the need for ICU treatment after dorsal spine surgery, guiding the surgeon through patient selection, communication, and ICU admission predictability.",Cervicothoracic junction;Intensive care unit admission;Risk factors;Spinal deformity;Spine surgery,trauma
Assessment of the Initial Diagnostic Accuracy of a Fragility Fracture of the Sacrum: A Study of 56 Patients.,"Retrospective study. To investigate the clinical manifestations of a fragility fracture of the sacrum (FFS) and the factors that may contribute to a misdiagnosis. The number of patients diagnosed with FFS has increased because of extended life expectancy and osteoporosis. Patients with FFS may report nonspecific symptoms, such as back, buttock, groin, and/or leg pain, leading to a misdiagnosis and a delay in definitive diagnosis. Fifty-six patients (13 males and 43 females) with an average age of 80.2±9.2 years admitted to the hospital for FFS between 2006 and 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. The following patient data were collected using medical records: pain regions, a history of trauma, initial diagnoses, and rates of fracture detection using radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Forty-one patients presented with low back and/or buttock pain, nine presented with groin pain, and 17 presented with thigh or leg pain. There was no history of trauma in 18 patients (32%). At the initial visit, 27 patients (48%) were diagnosed with sacral or pelvic fragility fractures. In contrast, 29 patients (52%) were initially misdiagnosed with lumbar spine disease (23 patients), hip joint diseases (three patients), and buttock bruises (three patients). Fracture detection rates for FFS were 2% using radiography, 71% using CT, and 93% using MRI. FFS was diagnosed definitively using an MRI with a coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. Some patients with FFS have leg pain with no history of trauma and are initially misdiagnosed as having lumbar spine disease, hip joint disease, or simple bruises. When these clinical symptoms are reported, we recommend considering FFS as one of the differential diagnoses and performing lumbar or pelvic MRIs, particularly coronal STIR images, to rule out FFS.",Insufficiency fractures;Magnetic resonance imaging;Misdiagnosis;Sacrum,trauma
Screening tools for sepsis identification in paramedicine and other emergency contexts: a rapid systematic review.,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that contributes significantly to protracted hospitalisations globally. The unique positioning of paramedics and other emergency care cadres in emergency contexts enable the prospect of early identification and management of sepsis, however, a standardised screening tool still does not exist in the emergency setting. The objective of this review was to identify and recommend the most clinically ideal sepsis screening tool for emergency contexts such as emergency departments and out-of-hospital emergency contexts. A rapid review of five databases (Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and ProQuest Central) was undertaken, with searches performed on February 10, 2022. Covidence software was used by two authors for initial screening, and full text review was undertaken independently by each reviewer, with conflicts resolved by consensus-finding and a mediator. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, and prospective observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Data extraction used an a priori template and focused on sensitivity and specificity, with ROBINS-I and ROBIS bias assessment tools employed to assess risk of bias in included studies. Study details and key findings were summarised in tables. The a priori review protocol was registered on Open Science Framework ( https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3XQ5T ). The literature search identified 362 results. After review, 18 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. There were five systematic reviews, with three including meta-analysis, eleven prospective observational studies, one randomised controlled trial, and one validation study. The review recognised that a paucity of evidence exists surrounding standardised sepsis screening tools in the emergency context. The use of a sepsis screening tool in the emergency environment may be prudent, however there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a single screening tool for this context. A combination of the qSOFA and SIRS may be employed to avoid 'practice paralysis' in the interim. The authors acknowledge the inherent potential for publication and selection bias within the review due to the inclusion criteria.",Emergency;Paramedicine;SIRS;Screening tools;Sepsis;qSOFA,trauma
Downregulation of pro-surfactant protein B contributes to the recurrence of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer by activating PGK1-mediated Akt signaling.,"Recurrence is one of the main causes of treatment failure in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there are no predictors of the recurrence of early-stage NSCLC, and the molecular mechanism of its recurrence is not clear. In this study, we used clinical sample analysis to demonstrate that low levels of expression of precursor surfactant protein B (pro-SFTPB) in primary NSCLC tissue compared to their adjacent tissues are closely correlated with recurrence and poor prognosis in early-stage NSCLC patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that downregulation of pro-SFTPB expression activates the Akt pathway by upregulating PGK1, which promotes metastasis and tumorigenicity in NSCLC cells. We then demonstrated that pro-SFTPB suppresses the formation of the ADRM1/hRpn2/UCH37 complex by binding to ADRM1, which inhibits PGK1 deubiquitination, thus accelerating ubiquitin-mediated PGK1 degradation. In summary, our findings indicate that low expression of pro-SFTPB in primary NSCLC compared to their adjacent tissue has potential as a predictor of recurrence and poor prognosis in early-stage NSCLC. Mechanistically, downregulation of pro-SFTPB attenuates inhibition of ADRM1-deubiquitinated PGK1, resulting in elevated levels of PGK1 protein; this activates the Akt pathway, ultimately leading to the progression of early-stage NSCLC.",Akt pathway;Early-stage NSCLC;PGK1;Pro-SFTPB;Recurrence,trauma
"Practical psychosocial care for providers of pre-hospital care: a summary of the report 'valuing staff, valuing patients'.","Caring for people who are ill or injured in pre-hospital environments is emotionally draining and physically demanding. This article focuses on the Psychosocial and Mental Health Programme commissioned by the Faculty of Pre-Hospital Care (FPHC) at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) in 2018 to investigate the experiences and needs of responders to pre-hospital emergencies and make recommendations. It summarises the report to FPHC published in 2022, and adds material from research published subsequently. FPHC appointed a team to undertake the work. Team members conducted a literature review, and a systematic review of the literature concerning the impacts on the mental health of pre-hospital practitioners. They conducted fieldwork, participated in training and had conversations with trainees and established practitioners, and took evidence from the Pre-hospital Emergency Medicine Trainees Association (PHEMTA). The Results summarise the evidence-based theoretical background derived from the programme and practical guidance for practitioners, professional organisations, and employers who deliver pre-hospital care on the implications of, preventing and intervening with pre-hospital providers who experience psychosocial and mental health problems. This paper summarises the outputs from a multidisciplinary programme of scholarship, research, and fieldwork. The authors condense the findings and the guidance developed by the Programme Team to provide a summary of the report and guidance on implementation. They believe that the recommendations are applicable to all healthcare organisations and particularly those that employ responders to emergencies and provide pre-hospital care.",Mental health;Model of care;Pre-hospital emergency medicine;Psychosocial needs;Secondary stressors;Systematic review;Trainees;Wellbeing,trauma
Cognitive and affective control for adolescents in care versus their peers: implications for mental health.,"Many adolescents who have been removed from the care of their biological parent(s) and placed in State or Local Authority care have experienced significant adversity, including high rates of maltreatment and other trauma(s). As a group, these young people experience far higher rates of mental health difficulties compared to their peers. While their mental health outcomes are well-documented, little is known about mechanisms that may drive this. One potential mechanism, linked to both trauma and adversity exposure and mental health, is affective control (the application of cognitive control in affective contexts). We compared cognitive and affective control in 71 adolescents (65% girls) in care aged 11-18 (M = 14.82, SD = 2.10) and 71 age and gender-matched peers aged 11-19 years (M = 14.75, SD = 1.95). We measured cognitive and affective control using standard experimental tasks, and for those in care, we also examined associations with self-reported emotion regulation, mental health, and school well-being. After controlling for IQ, there was a significant group difference in affective control performance, with those in care on average performing worse across all tasks. However, further analyses showed this was driven by deficits in overall cognitive control ability, and was not specific to, or worsened by, affective stimuli. Further, we found no evidence that either cognitive or affective control was associated with emotion regulation abilities or the mental health and well-being of young people in care. Results suggest that cognitive and affective control may not underlie mental health for young people in care, though limitations should be considered. We discuss implications for theory and intervention development, and avenues for further research. https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/QJVDA.",Affective control;Care-experience;Emotion regulation;Mental health;Post-traumatic stress,trauma
Extracellular vesicles derived from endothelial cells modulate macrophage phenotype in vitro.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate cell-to-cell communication by horizontally transferring biological materials from host cells to target cells. During exposure to pathogens, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e.g., lipopolysaccharide, LPS) get in contact with endothelial cells and stimulate the secretion of endothelial cell-derived EVs (E-EVs). The triggered EVs secretion is known to have a modulating influence on the EVs-receiving cells. Macrophages, a major component of innate immunity, are polarized upon receiving external inflammatory stimuli, in which toll-like receptor4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway plays a key role. However, the functions of LPS-induced E-EVs (ELPS-EVs) in modulating macrophage phenotype and activation remain elusive. We collected the EVs from quiescent endothelial cells (ENor-EVs) and ELPS-EVs to detect their stimulatory role on NR8383 macrophages. Isolated EVs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), western blot assay, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). NR8383 macrophages were stimulated with ELPS-EVs, ENor-EVs, or PBS for 24 h. Hereafter, the uptake of EVs by the macrophages was investigated. Upon EVs stimulation, cellular viability was determined by MTT assay, while macrophage phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, a western blot assay was conducted to evaluate the potentially involved TLR4-NFκB pathway. Interestingly, upon exposure to LPS, endothelial cells secreted significantly higher amounts of EVs (i.e., ELPS-EVs) when compared to quiescent cells or cells in PBS. The ELPS-EVs were also better internalized by NR8383 macrophages than ENor-EVs. The cellular viability of ELPS-EVs-treated macrophages was 1.2 times higher than those in the ENor-EVs and PBS groups. In addition, ELPS-EVs modulated NR8383 macrophages towards a proinflammatory macrophage M1-like phenotype. This was indicated by the significantly upregulated expressions of proinflammatory macrophage biomarkers CD86 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) observed in ELPS-EVs-treated macrophages. The TLR4-NFκB signaling pathway was substantially activated in ELPS-EVs-treated macrophages, indicated by the elevated expressions of makers TLR4 and phosphorylated form of nuclear factor kappa B p65 subunit (p-NFκBp65). Overall, our results indicate that E-EVs play a crucial role in macrophage phenotype modulation under inflammatory conditions.",Endothelial cells;Extracellular vesicles;Macrophages polarization;NFκB pathway,trauma
A modified chain-based sponge dressing controls junctional hemorrhage in the tactical combat casualty care simulation of pigs.,"Hemorrhage has always been the focus of battlefield and pre-hospitalization treatment. With the increasing fatality rates associated with junctional bleeding, treatment of bleeding at junctional sites has gradually gained attention in battlefield trauma emergency care. We designed a modified chain-based sponge dressing with a medical polyvinyl alcohol sponge that can be used to treat junctional hemorrhage and tested its hemostatic efficacy and biocompatibility. Twenty adult Bama miniature pigs were randomly divided into the modified chain-based sponge dressing (MCSD) and standard gauze (SG) groups. The right femoral artery of the pigs was shot at after anesthesia. The Bama miniature pigs were moved to the safety zone immediately to assess the condition according to the MARCH strategy, which evaluates massive hemorrhaging, airway obstruction, respiratory status, circulatory status, head injury & hypothermia. Hemoglobin and coagulation status were checked during the experiment.Among the pigs in which the inguinal hemorrhagic model based on bullet penetrating wounds was successfully established, those in the MCSD group received a disinfected MCSD for hemostasis, while those in the SG group received standard gauze in an imbricate manner to pack the bullet exit and entrance wounds to stop bleeding until the wound was filled, followed by compression for 3 min at sufficient pressure. CT scanning, transmission electron microscopy, and HE staining were conducted after experiment. The MCSD group showed lower hemostasis time and blood loss than the gauze group. The MCSD group also showed a higher success rate of treatment,more stable vital signs and hemoglobin level. The CT scanning results showed tighter packing without large gaps in the MCSD group. The histopathological assessments and the transmission electron microscopy and HE staining findings indicated good biocompatibility of the polyvinyl alcohol sponge. The MCSD met the battlefield's requirements of speedy hemostasis and biosafety for junctional hemorrhage in Bama miniature pigs. Moreover, in comparison with the conventional approach for hemostasis, it showed more stable performance for deep wound hemostasis. These findings provide the theoretical and experimental basis for the application of MCSD in the treatment of hemorrhage in the battlefield in the future.",Bullet penetrating wound;First aid of Hemorrhage;Modified chain-based sponge dressing;Polyvinyl alcohol;The junction,trauma
Serum glucose/potassium ratio as a clinical risk factor for predicting the severity and prognosis of acute traumatic spinal cord injury.,"Acute traumatic Spinal cord injury (TSCI) is a devastating event that causes severe sensory and motor impairments as well as autonomic dysfunction in patients, yet relevant clinical biomarkers have not been established. This study aimed to determine the significance of the serum glucose/potassium ratio (GPR) in evaluating TSCI severity and predicting prognosis. An analysis of 520 clinical records of acute TSCI patients from January 2012 to June 2022 was conducted. The relationships between serum GPR and The American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade 6-month post-trauma prognosis and the admission AIS grade were analyzed. To evaluate the discriminatory ability, a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Based on the initial assessment of AIS grade, 256 (49.2%) patients were categorized into the severe TSCI group (AIS A-B), and there was a significant correlation between the severe TSCI group and serum GPR (p < 0.001). Serum GPR was reduced in an AIS grade-dependent manner (R = - 0.540, p < 0.001). Of the 520 patients, 262 (50.4%) patients were classified as having a poor prognosis according to the AIS grade at discharge. Serum GPR was also reduced in an AIS grade at discharge-dependent manner (R = - 0.599, p < 0.001), and was significantly higher in the poor prognosis group compared to the good prognosis group (p < 0.001). Poor prognosis was significantly associated with sex (p = 0.009), severity of TSCI (p < 0.001), location of TSCI (p < 0.001), surgical decompression (p < 0.018), body temperature (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.001), systolic arterial pressure (SAP) (p < 0.001), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) (p < 0.001), serum GPR (p < 0.001), serum glucose (p < 0.001), serum potassium (p < 0.001), and white blood cell count (p = 0.003). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant correlation between poor prognosis and serum GPR (p = 0.023). The ROC analysis showed the area under the curve of serum GPR to be a poor predictor of prognosis in TSCI patients at 0.842 (95% confidence interval, 0.808-0.875). There was a significant relationship between serum GPR and admission injury severity and the 6-month prognosis of acute TSCI patients. Serum GPR serves as a readily available clinical risk factor for predicting the severity and 6-month prognosis of acute traumatic spinal cord injury, which holds potential clinical significance for patients with TSCI.",Acute traumatic spinal cord injury;Biomarker;Serum glucose;Serum glucose/potassium ratio;Serum potassium,trauma
Understanding needs and expectations to start effective communities of practice.,"Communities of practice (CoPs) are frequently used in health settings to enhance knowledge and support action around public health issues. Yet, most are ineffective and often at risk of not delivering on this promise. To prevent loss of time and resources by organisations, facilitators, and members, this paper argues for a reliable assessment of the needs of people who intend to join and to set realistic expectations to assure effective communities of practice. This research proposes a valid and reliable needs assessment and analysis tool for starting communities of practice, by presenting the results of using such a tool. Inception needs assessments were developed, tested and administered to 246 respondents entering five communities of practice that focused on one of three public health issues: health literacy, mental health literacy and trauma-informed care. One community of practice had a global audience, four were based in Australia. Data from the needs assessments were analysed qualitatively and supplemented with descriptive statistics. Results were used to develop an analysis tool to support future communities of practice. The short-term expectations of respondents included seeking to increase their knowledge and getting to know other members of the community of practice. Long-term expectations shifted towards undertaking action, collaborating and improving health outcomes. While respondents learning expectations included a wide range of topics, they articulated very specific knowledge they expected to share with others. There were high expectations of receiving practical support from the facilitator and a strong preference for meetings with synchronous interaction. Most respondents who planned to join focused initially on the direct and individual benefits and participation they expected from others, whereas they indicated limited intention to actively contribute to the learning needs of other community members. Respondents appeared to need to take time to build self-confidence and trust, and frequently applied a wait-and-see attitude. The findings of this study suggest that an inception needs assessment allows members to express their needs and expectations, which directly informs the direction and structure of a community of practice, gives voice to members, and supports facilitators in managing expectations.",Communities of practice;Health literacy;Knowledge translation;Mental health;Needs assessment;Public health;Trauma-informed care,trauma
Incidence of postoperative complications in patellar fractures related to different methods of osteosynthesis procedures - a retrospective cohort study.,"Patellar fractures have a comparatively low incidence compared to all fracture frequencies of the musculoskeletal system. However, surgical management is crucial to prevent postoperative complications that affect the knee joint. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative complications and onset of postoperative osteoarthritis related to the chosen technique of patellar fracture management. In a retrospective cohort study consecutive managed, isolated patella fractures were reviewed for demographic data, trauma mechanism, patella fracture type, fixation technique and postoperative complications. The results were documented radiographically and clinically and analysed statistically. The reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. A total of 112 patients were eligible for data evaluation. Surgical management of comminuted patellar fractures with small fragment screws showed significant fewer postoperative complications compared to other fixation techniques (8%, p < 0.043). The incidence of posttraumatic infection was significantly higher following the hybrid fixation technique with cannulated screws and tension wire than following the other analysed techniques (p = 0.024). No postoperative wound infection was observed after screw fixation or locking plate fixation. Symptomatic hardware was most frequently seen after tension-band fixation. Onset of posttraumatic osteoarthritis was most often found after the hybrid fixation technique (55%). Surgical management of patellar fractures remains crucial but fracture fixation using plating systems or small fragment screws is least associated with postoperative complications.

Walking against traffic and pedestrian injuries in the United Kingdom: new insights.,"Studies from Finland and Taiwan have shown that walking against traffic was beneficial for reducing pedestrian crashes and fatalities. This study examined whether such beneficial effects are consistent across various circumstances. This study aimed to investigate pedestrian fatalities in walking-against or with-traffic crashes by analysing the UK STATS19 crash data for the period between 1991 and 2020. We firstly employed Chi-square tests to examine risk factors for pedestrian injury severity. These variables were then incorporated into stepwise logistic regression models with multiple variables. We subsequently conducted joint effect analysis to investigate whether the beneficial effects of walking against traffic on injury severity vary across different situations. Our data contained 44,488 pedestrian crashes, of which 16,889 and 27,599 involved pedestrians walking against and with traffic, respectively. Pedestrians involved in with-traffic crashes were more likely to sustain fatalities (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.542; confidence interval [CI] = 1.139-1.927) compared with those in walking against-traffic crashes. The detrimental effect of walking with traffic on fatalities appeared to be more pronounced in darkness-unlit conditions (AOR = 1.48; CI = 1.29-1.70), during midnight hours (00:00-06:59 am) (AOR = 1.60; CI = 1.37-1.87), in rural areas (AOR = 2.20; CI = 1.92-2.51), when pedestrians were elderly (≥ 65 years old) (AOR = 2.65, CI = 2.16-3.26), and when heavy goods vehicles were crash partners (AOR = 1.51, CI = 1.28-1.78). Walking against traffic was beneficial in reducing pedestrian fatalities compared with walking with traffic. Furthermore, such a beneficial effect was more pronounced in darkness-unlit conditions, at midnights (00:00-06:59 am), in rural areas, when pedestrians were elderly, and when heavy goods vehicles struck pedestrians.",Fatalities;Joint Effects;Pedestrians;Walking against traffic;Walking with traffic,trauma
Metabolomics and machine learning approaches for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers screening in sepsis.,"Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a poor prognosis, and metabolic disorders play a crucial role in its development. This study aims to identify key metabolites that may be associated with the accurate diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. Septic patients and healthy individuals were enrolled to investigate metabolic changes using non-targeted liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry metabolomics. Machine learning algorithms were subsequently employed to identify key differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs). Prognostic-related DEMs were then identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The septic rat model was established to verify the effect of phenylalanine metabolism-related gene MAOA on survival and mean arterial pressure after sepsis. A total of 532 DEMs were identified between healthy control and septic patients using metabolomics. The main pathways affected by these DEMs were amino acid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. To identify sepsis diagnosis-related biomarkers, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) algorithms were employed, leading to the identification of four biomarkers. Additionally, analysis of transcriptome data from sepsis patients in the GEO database revealed a significant up-regulation of the phenylalanine metabolism-related gene MAOA in sepsis. Further investigation showed that inhibition of MAOA using the inhibitor RS-8359 reduced phenylalanine levels and improved mean arterial pressure and survival rate in septic rats. Finally, using univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis, six DEMs were identified as prognostic markers for sepsis. This study employed metabolomics and machine learning algorithms to identify differential metabolites that are associated with the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis patients. Unraveling the relationship between metabolic characteristics and sepsis provides new insights into the underlying biological mechanisms, which could potentially assist in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. This human study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Research Institute of Surgery (2021-179) and was registered by the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Date: 09/12/2021, ChiCTR2200055772).",Biomarker;Machine learning;Metabolomics;Phenylalanine metabolism;Sepsis,trauma
Prevalence of falls among adult mothers in Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study.,"The prevalence of falls among mothers (18-49 years old) in Saudi Arabia has been overlooked and understudied. Therefore, the study aimed to identify the 1-year prevalence, rate of falls, and consequent injuries among mothers in Saudi Arabia. In this cross-sectional study, a self-administered online questionnaire, including sociodemographic data and questions related to the history of falls and consequent injuries during the past 12 months, was disseminated through social media in Saudi Arabia. A convenience sample of 986 mothers were voluntarily recruited for this study with a median age of 33 years and an interquartile range of 10 years. The 1-year prevalence of falls among mothers was 14.1 % (n = 139), and 52.5 % (n = 73/139) of the fallers experienced more than one fall. Among mothers who had experienced a fall, 25.4 % (n = 33/139) experienced a fall incident during pregnancy. The reported consequences of falls were pain in 37.4 % (n = 52/139), muscle and ligament injuries in 7.2 % (n = 10/139), and fractures in 2.2 % (n = 3/139) of participants. The study's findings indicate that asthma and high cholesterol level predicts the risk of falls in mothers. According to our convenience sampling, 14.1% of mothers had experienced one or more falls in the past 12 months. The increased prevalence of falls among this age group of women supports the idea that falls are not only an issue for the older adult population, but fall prevention strategies for this age range are also needed.",Accidental falls;Mothers;Pregnant women;Prevalence;Woman’s health,trauma
"Women's expectations about birth, requests for pain relief in labor and the subsequent development of birth dissonance and trauma.","Birth is a significant event in women's lives. As Mansfield notes (2008) many women aim for a birth that avoids pharmacological pain relief because they are advised it is better for them and their baby. For women having their first baby, this may not be realistic as 3/4 of primiparous women in Australia will use pharmacological pain relief. This study examines the expectations that a group of women had regarding pain relief, how these expectations developed and what happened to requests for pain relief in labour. A longitudinal prospective study design was used to recruit 15 women who were having their first baby. Women having low risk pregnancies, hoping for a 'natural birth' (vaginal, no/minimal pharmacological pain relief) were eligible. A semi-structured interview tool was used across all three interviews that asked women about their expectations, then actual labour experience, pain management requests and how these were responded to by carers. Fifteen women were interviewed - at 36 weeks gestation; as soon after delivery of their baby as possible, then six months post-delivery (N = 43 interviews). Interviews were recorded and transcribed and coded by ES using NVivo software with hierarchical thematic analysis used. The study found that women appear to experience a mismatch between expectations they had developed pre-birth, versus actual experience. This appears to cause a specific form of dissonance - which we have termed 'birth dissonance' leaving them feeling traumatised post birth. This is because what women expected to happen in birth was often not realised. In particular, some women requested pain relief in birth and felt that their request was not responded to as hoped, and also seemed to develop post-birth trauma. We proposed that this may have resulted from dissonance arising from their expectations about being able to birth without significant pain relief. Interventions and technology may also contribute to this sense of mismatch and post-birth trauma. Low risk birthing women birthing in a hospital may have to engage with higher levels of technology, intervention and pain relief than that which they expected pre-birth. This could possibly be avoided with four simple changes. Firstly, better pre-birth education for women about how painful labor is likely to be. Secondly, pre-birth education which includes a detailed explanation of the utility of pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain relief. Thirdly, more egalitarian decision-making during labour and finally delivering upon women's requests for pain relief in labor, at the time that they ask for it. Further research is required to determine the extent of birth dissonance and how women making the transition to motherhood can avoid it.",Dissonance (cognitive);Labor;Midwifery;Natural childbirth;Normal childbirth;Obstetrics;Pain management;Request;Women,trauma
Role of emergency teleradiology in a mass motorcycle event: the experience of the 2021 International Six Days of Enduro (ISDE).,"Provision of healthcare support at mass gathering sporting events is of paramount importance for the success of the event. Many of such events, like motorsports, have been increasingly taking place in remote and austere environments. In these settings, the use of first-line diagnostic tools, such as point of care ultrasound and portable X-ray, could aid in definitive care on the field for patients with minor trauma while also ensuring fast access to the appropriate level of care for patients requiring hospitalization. As part of the ISDE 2021 medical response plan, a field hospital equipped with portable digital X-ray and telemedicine was established. Data on patient admission, triage, treatments, diagnostics, and outcomes were collected for analysis. During the 6-day competition, 79 patients sought medical care at the field hospital, with traumatic injuries accounting for 77% of cases. Of these, 47 were athletes and 32 were non-athletes. The majority (91%) arrived spontaneously, while 9% were transported directly. Upon admission, 68 patients were triaged as non-urgent (code 3) and 11 as urgent (code 2). Of those admitted, 69 received treatment and were discharged at the field hospital, while 10 were transferred elsewhere. Notably, four patients had major trauma, two had isolated fractures, and one needed a CT scan after losing consciousness. Overall, 29 missions were conducted on the race field, including 13 primary transports to local hospitals and 6 to the field hospital. Primary transport was primarily due to major trauma. Among 31 patients who had radiological exams, 11 (35.5%) had traumatic injuries. Of these, 5 were treated with braces and casts and discharged without hospitalization, 3 were advised for post-event care, and 3 were hospitalized. In contrast, patients with negative X-rays received on-site treatment, with 7 able to continue competing. In summary, the successful implementation of portable X-ray machines and teleradiology at remote and austere high-risk sporting events holds great promise for enhancing on-site medical capabilities, allowing clinicians informed decisions, avoiding unnecessary hospitalization, and allowing athletes to continue with their competition. Provided that challenges related to cost, safety, connectivity, and power supply are effectively addressed.",E-health;Medical capabilities;Portable X-ray;Radiation safety;Remote care;Remote settings;Sporting events;Telehealth;Telemedicine;Teleradiology;Traumatic injuries,trauma
The elusive nature of the oligoclonal bands in multiple sclerosis.,"Intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and oligoclonal bands (OCBs) detected in both the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are seminal features of multiple sclerosis (MS). The presence of OCBs correlates with elevated disease burden and severity and supports the diagnosis of MS. Despite numerous investigations into the potential viral and autoantigen targets, the precise antigenic specificity of OCBs has remained elusive. We have little knowledge of the nature regarding these oligoclonal IgG bands. Here, we present compelling evidence highlighting the key findings that both OCBs and intrathecal IgG antibodies are under genetic control and that OCBs originate from clonal B-cells in both the periphery and CNS. We propose that MS OCBs are IgG immune complexes composed of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies and that the pathological role of OCB stems from the IgG effector functions of these complexes, leading to demyelination and axonal injuries. We present additional evidence regarding the nature of MS OCBs: (1) disease-modifying therapies have been shown to affect CSF OCB; (2) OCBs have also been detected in several neuroinfectious diseases; (3) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been particularly linked with MS pathogenesis, and its association with OCB is an important area of study. Although OCBs are closely associated with MS, more meticulously planned research is necessary to clarify the precise role of OCB in MS, both in terms of disease pathogenesis and diagnosis.",Antigen;B-cell;Cerebrospinal fluid;Immune complexes;Intrathecal IgG;Multiple sclerosis;Oligoclonal bands;Virus,trauma
Deep brain stimulation in disorders of consciousness: 10 years of a single center experience.,"Disorders of consciousness (DoC), namely unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), represent severe conditions with significant consequences for patients and their families. Several studies have reported the regaining of consciousness in such patients using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subcortical structures or brainstem nuclei. Our study aims to present the 10 years' experience of a single center using DBS as a therapy on a cohort of patients with DoC. Eighty Three consecutive patients were evaluated between 2011 and 2022; entry criteria consisted of neurophysiological and neurological evaluations and neuroimaging examinations. Out of 83, 36 patients were considered candidates for DBS implantation, and 32 patients were implanted: 27 patients had UWS, and five had MCS. The stimulation target was the centromedian-parafascicular complex in the left hemisphere in hypoxic brain lesion or the one better preserved in patients with traumatic brain injury. The level of consciousness was improved in seven patients. Three out of five MCS patients emerged to full awareness, with the ability to interact and communicate. Two of them can live largely independently. Four out of 27 UWS patients showed consciousness improvement with two patients emerging to full awareness, and the other two reaching MCS. In patients with DoC lasting longer than 12 months following traumatic brain injury or 6 months following anoxic-ischemic brain lesion, spontaneous recovery is rare. Thus, DBS of certain thalamic nuclei could be recommended as a treatment option for patients who meet neurological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging criteria, especially in earlier phases, before occurrence of irreversible musculoskeletal changes. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of cooperation between centers worldwide in studies on the potentials of DBS in treating patients with DoC.",,trauma
"Global epidemiology of geriatric burns, capacities of care, and injury outcomes: Perspectives from the World Health Organization global burn registry.","An increasing aging population alongside a potentially increasing injury risk emphasizes a critical need for evidence-based burn care regarding preventive and therapeutic strategies tailored to the unique needs of older adults. However, we note a critical gap in understanding geriatric burn trends on a global scale and the care capacity across settings. Thus, this study sought to ascertain the global trend of geriatric burns with a focus on patient demographics, injury characteristics, capacities of care, and injury outcomes. A retrospective design focusing on older adults aged ≥ 60 years with burns recorded in the World Health Organization Global Burn Registry as of 31st May 2023 was employed. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the data. Of the 9277 records obtained from the Global Burn Registry, 849 participants (9.2%) were aged ≥ 60 years with the majority of these reported from the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) and Southeast Asia (SEARO) regions. More females than males were involved in burn injuries with the most common aetiological factor being flame. Most burns occurred in the home/ domestic setting with a seasonal variation (more injuries occurred in December and January). In terms of burn care capacity, the data suggest the availability of specialized services in most settings albeit the AFRO and SEARO regions still lacked the resources to offer specialized burn care. While most injured older adults were discharged home with no physical impairment (395, 46.5%), a substantial number died (250, 29.4%) during hospitalization, particularly in the African (AFRO) region and 111 (11.1%) left the facility against medical advice with the majority from the SEARO region (88). Burn injuries in older adults remain a public health issue. On the preventive aspect, the results demonstrate a need to intensify safety in the home or domestic setting, and during festive seasons. Therapeutically, the findings underscore a need to consider the inclusion of more specialist geriatric and palliative care services in the burn management process. Additionally, we identified a need to strengthen burn care capacity in the AFRO and SEARO regions.",Burns;Care capacity;Geriatrics;Global Burn Registry;Prevention,trauma
Predictors of mortality following electrical and lightning injuries in Malawi: A decade of experience.,"Electrical injuries can be devastating, and data is lacking in low-resource settings. We aimed to identify predictors of mortality following electrical and lightning injuries (ELI) in Malawi. We performed a retrospective observational study of patients presenting with ELI and burn injuries at a tertiary hospital in Malawi from 2011 to 2020. Outcomes were compared and predictors of mortality were modeled. A total of 382 ELI and 6371 burn patients were included. The mean ages for ELI and burn groups were 24 ± 14 and 11 ± 14 years, respectively (p < 0.01). Most patients were injured at home (91% in the burn group versus 51% in the ELI group, p < 0.01). The crude mortality rate in the ELI group was 28%, compared to 12% in the burn group (p < 0.01). On multivariate logistic regression, predictors of mortality included ELI (odds ratio [OR] 13.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.2-24.5) and total body surface area burned (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.1). Predicted mortality for ELI has increased over time (p = 0.05). ELI confers more than 13 times higher odds of mortality than burn injuries in Malawi, with mortality risk increasing over time. More efforts are needed to prevent electrical hazards and implement timely interventions for patients with ELI.",Burns;Electrical injuries;Lightning;Malawi;Trauma,trauma
Long-term sequelae of photic eye injury from a solar eclipse.,"Photic ocular injuries are secondary traumatic injuries resulting from the toxic effects of the interaction between light and the eye, particularly the retina. We report the cases of two patients who experienced photic macular injury from their early childhood due to observing a solar eclipse without protection. The retinal lesions are mainly macular; these can be serious and irreversible. They are the consequence of photochemical, photomechanical and photothermal reactions. OCT is very useful for the diagnosis of these foveal lesions. The visual prognosis of solar retinopathy is generally favorable. However, some patients may develop permanent sequelae with a decrease in visual acuity. Management remains empirical and controversial. Thus, prevention and public education remain the only effective ways to avoid this type of trauma.","Eclipse;Fovea;Fovéa;OCT;Photic injury;Phototraumatismes, éclipse;Rétinopathie solaire;Solar retinopathy",trauma

Injury-related emergency department use among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities insured by Medicaid from 2010 to 2016.,"Data on non-fatal injuries and visits to the emergency department (ED) for injuries are not readily available. The objective of this paper is to describe injury-related ED visits for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are covered by the Medicaid insurance programme. We aggregated 2010-2016 Medicaid claims data from eight states. Using these data, we identified individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and then determined an all-cause ED visit rate, ED visit due to injury rate and admission from ED due to injury rate. Data were stratified by sex and age group. Results were compared with national rates. Medicaid members with intellectual and developmental disabilities visited EDs at approximately 1.8 times the rate of the general population. The ED visit rate due to injury was approximately 1.5 times that observed in the population overall. When ED visits due to injury data were stratified by age and sex, the largest discrepancy was observed in women ages 45-64, who visited EDs due to injury at a rate 2.1 times that of women of the same age in the general population. The admission rate from ED due to injury increased over the study period most notably in the older age groups. While rates and patterns of ED utilisation among Medicaid members with intellectual and developmental disabilities vary by age and gender, our findings suggest this group visits the ED due to injury at rates well above the general population.",Barell Matrix;Descriptive Epidemiology;Disability;Injury Diagnosis;Surveillance,trauma
'More than likely the men come first. That's just very frustrating'. A qualitative exploration of contextual factors affecting the implementation of injury prevention initiatives and the provision of effective injury management in elite-level women's club football in Ireland.,"The aim of our study was to explore the contextual factors that affect the implementation of football injury prevention initiatives and the provision of effective injury management in the Irish Women's National League (WNL). We used a criterion-based purposive sampling approach to recruit coaches (n=7), players (n=17) and medical personnel (n=8) representing eight of the nine clubs in the WNL to participate in one-to-one semistructured interviews. Our study was located within an interpretivist, constructivist research paradigm. The interview data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. The participants identified academic and work pressures, financial challenges, conflict with college football, inadequate facilities and gender inequity as being barriers to the implementation of injury prevention initiatives and the provision of effective injury management. Financial constraints within clubs were perceived to limit the provision of medical care and strength and conditioning (S&C) support and this was deemed to be associated with a heightened risk of injuries. Specific contextual factors were identified which curtail the implementation of injury prevention initiatives and the provision of effective injury management in elite-level women's club football in Ireland. Gender inequity was identified as one of the factors impacting the availability of high-quality medical care, S&C support, as well as access to training and match facilities. Our results provide new insights that could be used to inform the design and implementation of injury prevention and management initiatives for women football players in Ireland.",Football;Soccer;Sports medicine;Women;Wounds and Injuries,trauma
Ukraine Trauma Project: the feasibility of introducing advanced trauma-care skills to frontline emergency medical services responders.,"To design, develop, deliver and assess a training initiative on haemorrhage control for emergency medical services (EMS) staff in Ukraine, in an active wartime setting. Using the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions, a training programme was designed and developed in a collaboration between Irish and Ukrainian colleagues and delivered by experienced prehospital clinicians/educators. Feedback was gathered from participants. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused large numbers of trauma patients with limited access to advanced prehospital emergency care. Ukrainian authorities requested support in delivering such care. Ukrainian EMS nominated clinical staff as trainees, in partnership with an educational institution in Kyiv. One day provider and train-the-trainer courses were developed and delivered, focused on early delivery of tranexamic acid (TXA), using intraosseous access (IO) in victims of wartime trauma. Safe organisation and delivery of courses, assessed knowledge and skills competence and self-reported satisfaction and pre/post confidence/competence. Two provider and one train-the-trainer courses and four equipment supply exercises were delivered for 89 EMS staff (doctors, nurses, paramedics); none had prior experience of IO or prehospital delivery of TXA. All participants were assessed as competent as providers and/or trainers. High levels of satisfaction and significantly improved self-assessed confidence and competence were reported. Rapid design and delivery of a training programme focused on an identified need for advanced care of trauma patients in a wartime setting has been possible. Training and immediate access to appropriate equipment was demonstrated. Evidence of frequency of use and safe, effective interventions has not been collected; such data are important for evaluation but difficult to collect in this setting.

Omental infarction in an overweight child: conservative treatment is a safe approach.,"A previously healthy but overweight (body mass index (BMI) of 24.4) adolescent boy presented with fever and significant right-sided abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed an omental infarction (OI), which was treated conservatively. OI has been described in overweight teenage children with abdominal trauma but can be missed if not considered. A missed diagnosis could result in an unnecessary laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery. Although CT is the gold standard for diagnosis, ultrasonography is an effective approach to identifying OI in children. The benefits of early diagnosis of OI by abdominal ultrasound include a shorter hospital stay and a reduction in unnecessary investigations and surgery.",Emergency medicine;Paediatrics (drugs and medicines);Trauma,trauma
Identification of Candida auris by PCR and assessment of biofilm formation by crystal violet assay.,"Candida auris is a notorious pathogen capable of forming biofilms on devices as well as host tissues, often culminating in infections. We evaluated characteristics of infections and the methods to diagnose C. auris over a period of three years in a tertiary care hospital. Patients admitted between 2018 and 2020, who had candidemia due to C. auris were included in the study. Identification was performed using HiCrome™ Candida Differential Agar, Vitek 2 (BioMérieux, Inc., Marcy-l'Etoile, France) and MALDI-TOF, Vitek-MS. Identification was confirmed by detection of rDNA region covering part of 5.8S, entire of ITS2, and part of 28S by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Biofilm formation was assessed by crystal violet staining. Presence of central line and broad spectrum antimicrobials were noted in all patients whereas total parenteral nutrition was given in 82.1% of these patients. Identification by Vitek2 v8.1 correlated with MALDI-TOF MS. PCR products of length 163 ​bp were obtained in all isolates as visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The biofilm quantity measured as A560 of the twenty-eight C. auris isolates ranged from 0.16 to 0.80 compared to C. albicans. C. auris can be identified by PCR targeting specific rDNA region.

Myeloperoxidase Staining Identifies Endothelial Injury of Peritubular Capillaries and Glomeruli in Renal Antibody-Mediated Rejection.,"It remains unclear if C4d staining is related to any peritubular and glomerular injury during antibody mediated rejection (ABMR). The goal of this study was to determine if myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining can highlight endothelial injury in peritubular capillaries (PTC) and glomeruli. The study included 12 native negative controls, 19 transplant biopsies with borderline changes (BC) as transplant controls, and one group of renal transplant biopsies with ABMR as the study group (acute/chronic, n=22). All three groups were stained for MPO immunohistochemically, and the MPO expressions in the endothelium of PTC and glomeruli were evaluated and correlated with serum creatinine (SCr). In addition, the ultrastructural layers of the PTC (an index for chronic allograft rejection) were correlated with MPO indices in PTC. The negative control group and the transplant controls showed no MPO expression in the endothelium of glomeruli and PTC. However, in the biopsies with ABMR, there were MPO-positive stains in the endothelial cells of glomeruli (15/21 cases, 71.4 %) and PTC (16/22 cases, 72.7 %). There were significant correlations between the peritubular MPO staining versus SCr (r=0.355 and p=0.0106) and glomerular MPO staining versus SCr (r=0.365 and p=0.0092). Furthermore, the layers of PTC by electron microscopy were significantly correlated with MPO scores in PTC (r=0.696, p=0.0001). Our data suggest that the MPO-positive endothelial injuries are most likely the cause leading to renal graft dysfunction following ABMR.",acute kidney injury;antibody-mediated rejection;glomerular capillary;immunohistochemical staining;peritubular capillary,trauma
Hysteroscopy In Preserving Fertility Of Women With Abnormal Pregnancy.,"Hysteroscopy has a positive role in the treatment of abnormal pregnancy, with less damage to the patient, good surgical effect, rapid postoperative recovery, and positive clinical value. This work aimed to explore the role and value of hysteroscopy in preserving the fertility of women with abnormal pregnancies. 60 patients with abnormal pregnancies in Maanshan Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital were enrolled from December 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022. They were grouped Based on treatment methods: controls (30 cases) and observation groups (30 cases). The average age of the control group was 30.66 ± 5.32 years, with a BMI of 23.36 ± 2.15 kg/m2, and an educational duration of 12.24 ± 3.61 years. The observation group had an average age of 30.18 ± 5.71 years, a BMI of 23.23 ± 2.53 kg/m2, and an educational duration of 12.33 ± 3.28 years. Controls adopted the traditional method (laparoscopic surgery), and an observation group was given with hysteroscopic localization and removal of pregnancy products. The surgical conditions, postoperative recovery, cure rate, complications, preoperative and postoperative blood human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) score were compared between the two groups. The observation group had a significantly shorter surgical time of 10.22 minutes, a postoperative hemostasis time of 7.32 days, a menstrual recovery time of 25.73 days, and a time for blood HCG turning negative of 10.76 days compared to the control group (P < .05). The observation group also experienced significantly less intraoperative bleeding, with 6.22 ml compared to 11.69 ml in the control group (P < .05). The cure rate of controls was 83.33%, and that of the observation group was 100.00%. The cure rate of the observation group was obviously higher as against controls. The incidence of complications in the observation group was 6.67%, and that in controls was 26.67%. The incidence of complications in the observation group was clearly lower as against controls. Through operation, the serum HCG levels of two groups were clearly decreased, the SF-36 scores were clearly increased, and the changes in the observation group were more obvious (P < .05). Compared to traditional surgery, hysteroscopy examination demonstrates multiple advantages in the management of abnormal pregnancies, primarily attributed to its minimally invasive nature, high precision, minimal tissue trauma, and quick recovery. This contributes to providing a safer and more effective treatment, increasing patient satisfaction, and reducing healthcare costs, with a positive impact on patient care and clinical practice. However, this work had a relatively small sample size, a single source of patients, and a short duration, which necessitates future validation through the expansion of the sample size and multicenter research. A more comprehensive assessment of long-term postoperative effects is required to confirm the long-term advantages of this treatment method.",,trauma
Imaging findings and treatment in coccydynia - update of the recent study findings.,"Coccydynia is one of the most overlooked symptoms in clinical practice. The diagnosis and radiologic findings of traumatic coccyx can be more easily detected unless it is delayed and postponed. For idiopathic coccydynia, which accounts for one third of cases, patients present with long-standing pain and multiple physician visits. The keywords coccyx, coccydynia, coccygodynia were searched in PubMed, Embase, Scopus databases in the last 5 years. Research articles, reviews and case reports were analyzed. The studies conducted in the last 5 years were presented under the headings of etiology, radiologic assessment, interventional and surgical treatments. The first step is dynamic X-ray of the coccyx in standing and sitting position. In this way, morphologic parameters and hypermobility causing idiopathic coccydynia can be evaluated. Morphologic and morphometric features of the coccyx described in previous CT and MR studies have explained the relationship with coccydynia. The key features are as follows: Type II coccyx morphology, subluxation of the intercoccygeal joint, presence of bony spicules. Knowledge of these definitions as well as the differential diagnosis in this anatomical region will help in reaching the correct diagnosis. The treatment of coccydynia is stepwise like the diagnosis. Conservative treatments are initiated first. Manipulations, ganglion impar block, injections, radiofrequency and shock treatments and finally coccygectomy are treatment methods reported. Radiologists should not overlook this region and should be familiar with the coccyx's morphologic appearance and the sacrococcygeal region's differential diagnosis. · The etiology of coccydynia usually includes trauma, obesity and female sex, special coccyx morphology, and coccygeal hypermobility.. · Coccyx fractures are defined into three groups as flexion type 1, compression type 2, and extension type 3.. · When evaluating coccydynia, the first step is a dynamic X-ray examination of the coccyx in standing and sitting position.. · Hypermobility is defined as more than 25 % posterior subluxation while sitting or more than 25° flexion while sitting.. · More than 35° posterior subluxation is considered significant hypermobility..",,trauma
Ultrasound in sports traumatology.,"Ultrasound (US) has numerous applications in sports traumatology. The technical progress of mobile US devices has led to increasing use of ultrasound as a primary diagnostic tool. New applications such as elastography and 3 D vascularization are used for special indications. The purpose of this review is to present the current status of ultrasound in the diagnosis of sports injuries and sport traumatology including established applications and new technical advances. US is presented both in its comparison to other imaging modalities and as a sole diagnostic tool. US can be used for initial diagnosis to improve the clinical examination and for intensive short-term follow-up imaging. The main areas of application are currently the diagnosis of acute muscle and tendon injuries as well as overuse injuries. In particular, the exclusion of structural muscle injuries can be adequately ensured with US in the majority of anatomical regions. The recently published guideline on fracture ultrasound has strengthened the clinical evidence in this area, especially in comparison to conventional radiography and in the development of algorithms and standards.

Evaluation of real and perceived risk to health care workers caring for patients with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in surgery and obstetrics.,"The Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is described as more contagious than previous variants. We sought to assess risk to health care workers (HCWs) caring for patients with COVID-19 in surgical/obstetrical settings, and the perception of risk amongst this group. From January to April 2022, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in patient, environmental (floor, equipment, passive air) samples, and HCWs' masks (inside surface) during urgent surgery or obstetrical delivery for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome was the proportion of HCWs' masks testing positive. Results were compared with our previous cross-sectional study involving obstetrical/surgical patients with earlier variants (2020-2021). HCWs completed a risk perception electronic questionnaire. 11 patients were included: 3 vaginal births and 8 surgeries. 5/108 samples (5%) tested positive (SARS-CoV-2 Omicron) viral RNA: 2/5 endotracheal tubes, 1/22 floor samples, 1/4 patient masks, and 1 nasal probe. No samples from the HCWs' masks (0/35), surgical equipment (0/10), and air (0/11) tested positive. No significant differences were found between the Omicron and 2020/21 patient groups' positivity rates (Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.838) or the level of viral load from the nasopharyngeal swabs (P = 0.405). Nurses had a higher risk perception than physicians (P = 0.038). No significant difference in contamination rates were found between SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and previous variants in surgical/obstetrical settings. This is reassuring as no HCW mask was positive and no HCW tested positive for COVID-19 post-exposure.",,trauma
Therapeutic Leukocytapheresis to relieve priapism due to leukostasis in CML patients: Our experience in a tertiary care centre.,"Hyperleukocytosis in leukemic patients may cause tumour lysis syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and leukostasis, resulting in decreased tissue perfusion and increasing the risk of mortality. Since the myeloid blasts are larger than lymphoid blasts and are less deformable, complications of leukostasis are seen more frequently in myeloid leukemia. Priapism is a less common complication associated with leukostasis in leukaemia patients that should be treated as soon as possible to avoid ischemic injuries. Although chemotherapeutic drugs such as hydroxyurea and imatinib are used to treat hyperleukocytosis in CML patients, leukocytapheresis (LCP) can achieve rapid cytoreduction. Prophylactic LCP could not offer any advantage over aggressive chemotherapy, but therapeutic leukocyte depletion has a proven role in patients having symptomatic leukostasis due to high tumour burden. Three patients with ischaemic priapism were reported at our institute's emergency department, where detumescence could not be achieved by distal shunting or aspiration with phenylephrine instillation. The procedure of therapeutic LCP was performed in all three patients on an emergency basis, which resolved painful priapism by rapid cytoreduction.",Cytoreduction;Hyperleukocytosis;Leukemia;Priapism;Therapeutic leukocytapheresis (LCP),trauma
Combined exposure to polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene microplastics induces liver injury and perturbs gut microbial and serum metabolic homeostasis in mice.,"A variety of microplastics (MPs) have become ubiquitous environmental pollutants, leading to inevitable human contact and health impacts. Most previous research has explored the toxic effects of a single type of MPs exposure. However, the effects of co-exposure to both common types of MPs, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS) MPs on mammals have not been explored. Here, adult mice were exposed to PS-PVC (1.0 µm PS and 2.0 µm PVC both at the concentration of 0.5 mg/day) for 60 days. The results showed that PS-PVC co-exposure-induced hepatotoxicity was evidenced by liver histopathological changes, the release of inflammatory cytokines, and the activation of oxidative stress. Moreover, the intestinal mucosal barrier was damaged after PS-PVC treatment. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing reported there was a marked shift in the gut microbial structure accompanied by decreased relative abundances of probiotics, such as Clostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006, Desulfovibrio, Clostridiales_unclassified and Ruminococcaceae_unclassified and increased the conditional pathogen abundances, such as Erysipelatoclostridium. Furthermore, the triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TCH) expression levels in the serum and liver were increased after PS-PVC co-exposure. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that there were 717 differential expression metabolites found in the positive- and negative-ion modes, including 476 up-regulated and 241 down-regulated, mainly enriched in butyrate metabolism, thiamine metabolism, and phenylacetate metabolism. In addition, remarked changes in the gut microbiota and serum metabolic profiles were closely related to hepatic and intestinal injuries after PS-PVC co-exposure. These results have provided new insights into the toxic effects of PS and PVC MPs co-exposure through the gut-liver axis and the health risks of PS and PVC MPs should be paid more attention to humans.",Intestinal microbiota;Liver injury;Microplastics;Polystyrene;Polyvinyl chloride,trauma
"Postoperative scaphoid alignment, smoking, and avascular necrosis mostly influence union rate after scaphoid reconstruction: Results from a retrospective single center study involving 370 patients.","Current literature does not definitely demonstrate the superiority of any particular scaphoid reconstruction method. The primary goal of this retrospective single center study was to evaluate the influence of reconstruction techniques and other factors on the union rate after reconstruction of scaphoid nonunions. In the study, 370 patients with nonunions classified as stable (Mayo 1) or unstable (Mayo 2) depending on carpal alignment were included. Minimal radiological follow-up was 3 months. Bone healing after scaphoid reconstruction was evaluated using computer tomography scans in 294 and radiograms in 76 patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were applied in the analysis. Eight statistically significant factors that influenced the union rate were fixation method, type of previous operations, number of all operations, number of reconstructions, smoking, postoperative pathological lateral intrascaphoid angle (LISA>45°), avascular necrosis (AVN), and stability of nonunion. Smoking and postoperative LISA>45° significantly reduced the probability of bone fusion by approximately 4.4 and 9.5 times, respectively. Patients with reduced vascularity in the nonunion site had a 5.2 times lower chance of bone fusion. Our multivariate logistic regression model can explain 32% of failures after scaphoid reconstruction, including postoperative LISA>45°, patients' present record of smoking, and reduced vascularity in the nonunion site. However, bone graft type does not impact the union rate in general; however, in case of AVN, the tendency toward higher union rates was observed for medial femoral condyle free flaps when compared to other types of graft (non-vascularized and pedicled bone grafts considered as one group, p = 0.09).",Avascular necrosis;Bone grafting;Scaphoid malunion;Scaphoid nonunion;Scaphoid reconstruction;Union rate,trauma
Management of complex pilon fractures: Is it necessary to fix all the columns in AO/OTA type 43-C fractures?,"Surgical treatment of AO/OTA 43-C pilon fractures has not yet taken a standard form. We aimed to evaluate whether patients that appeared to be labelled as unsupported columns according to the four-column theory would affect long-term clinical and radiological outcomes. Patients with AO/OTA 43-C type who were treated surgically between January 2010 and December 2019 were included in the study. 53 fractures in 52 patients who received osteosynthesis were categorized based on the fixed columns. These groups were formed as fully supported columns (FSC- Group A), partly supported columns (PSC-Group B), Ankle range of motions (ROM), Burwell Charnley's reduction evaluation criteria, Kellgren-Lawrence ankle osteoarthritis staging system, and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Scoring System, Olerud-Molander Ankle Score, Visual Analog Scale were used for evaluating radiological and functional outcomes. The mean follow-up period was 72.6 (12-131) months. Mean age was 42.6 (18-76). Two groups were homogenously distributed in terms of age (p = 0.785), sex (p = 0.376), laterality (p = 0.732), smoking status (p = 0.488) and reduction quality. There was no difference in AOFAS score (p = 0.452), Olerud-Molander score (p = 0.354) and VAS scores (p = 0.589). TAS, TLS and TT angle measurements suggested no difference between groups (p = 0.493, p = 0.834, p = 0.577). There was no difference between groups in terms of infection (p = 0.734), malunion (p = 0.688) and arthritis (p = 0.483) CONCLUSION: We presented findings that contradicted the hypothesis positing the existence of four distinct columns in pilon fractures, as well as the notion that each fractured column requires support from distinct implants.

Prevalence of use and impairment from drugs and alcohol among trauma patients: A national prospective observational study.,"Being under the influence of psychoactive substances increases the risk of involvement in and dying from a traumatic event. The study is a prospective population-based observational study that aims to determine the prevalence of use and likely impairment from psychoactive substances among patients with suspected severe traumatic injury. This study was conducted at 35 of 38 Norwegian trauma hospitals from 1 March 2019 to 29 February 2020. All trauma admissions for patients aged ≥ 16 years admitted via trauma team activation during the study period were eligible for inclusion. Blood samples collected on admission were analysed for alcohol, benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-like hypnotics (Z-drugs), opioids, stimulants, and cannabis (tetrahydrocannabinol). Of the 4878 trauma admissions included, psychoactive substances were detected in 1714 (35 %) and in 771 (45 %) of these, a combination of two or more psychoactive substances was detected. Regarding the level of impairment, 1373 (28 %) admissions revealed a concentration of one or more psychoactive substances indicating likely impairment, and 1052 (22 %) highly impairment. Alcohol was found in 1009 (21 %) admissions, benzodiazepines and Z-drugs in 613 (13 %), opioids in 467 (10 %), cannabis in 352 (7 %), and stimulants in 371 (8 %). Men aged 27-43 years and patients with violence-related trauma had the highest prevalence of psychoactive substance use with respectively 424 (50 %) and 275 (80 %) testing positive for one or more compounds. The results revealed psychoactive substances in 35 % of trauma admissions, 80 % of which were likely impaired at the time of traumatic injury. A combination of several psychoactive substances was common, and younger males and patients with violence-related injuries were most often impaired. Injury prevention strategies should focus on high-risk groups and involve the prescription of controlled substances. We should consider toxicological screening in trauma admissions and incorporation of toxicological data into trauma registries.",Alcohol;Benzodiazepines;Falls;Illicit drugs;Injury prevention;Opioids;Psychoactive substances;Road traffic injuries;Violent injuries;Z-drugs,trauma
Using experience sampling methodology (ESM) to improve our understanding of day-to-day intrusion frequency and related distress in survivors of trauma.,"Cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suggest that appraisals of traumatic sequelae and subsequent distress drive the development and maintenance of PTSD. Posttraumatic research has relied heavily on macro-longitudinal designs, with weeks or months between assessments of trauma-related cognitions and symptoms. The present study uses experience sampling methodology (ESM) better understand the day-to-day experiences of trauma exposed individuals. One-hundred trauma exposed adults reported their posttraumatic symptoms, interpretations, and behaviours four times a day over a 10-day ESM period. As anticipated, within-person fluctuations in negative appraisals of intrusions and maladaptive coping strategies (e.g., thought suppression) were significantly positively associated with intrusion frequency and related distress. In all cases, the associations for negative appraisals and maladaptive coping were stronger with intrusion related distress than intrusion frequency. The observed contemporaneous associations only demonstrate that variables reliably fluctuated together and cannot indicate causality. The findings demonstrate that day-to-day fluctuations in trauma related perceptions and sequelae are significant and should be explored alongside broader individual differences to advance our understanding of the development, maintenance, and treatment of PTSD.",Experience sampling methodology;Intrusions;PTSD,trauma
Reversal of pre-injury factor-Xa inhibitors with prothrombin complex concentrates in patients following traumatic brain injury.,"There is substantial debate on the best method to reverse factor Xa-inhibitors in patients following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) have been used for this indication but their role has been questioned. This study reported failure rates with PCC in patients following TBI and as a secondary objective, compared 4-factor (4 F-PCC) and activated PCC (APCC). Consecutive patients with TBI on factor Xa-inhibitors admitted to one of two trauma centers were retrospectively identified. Patients with penetrating TBI, delays in PCC administration (>6 h), receipt of tranexamic acid, factor VIIa or no follow up CT-scan were excluded. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as hematoma expansion > 20% from baseline for SDH, EDH or IPH, a new hematoma not present on the initial CT scan or any expansion of a SAH or IVH. Hematoma expansion was further categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic, designated by a change in the motor GCS score, neurologic exam or change ≥ 3 in NIH Stroke Scale. Multi-variate analysis was performed. There were 43 patients with a mean age of 77 ± 13 years with primarily mild TBI (95%) after a ground level fall (79%). The mean dose was 41 ± 12 units/kg. Sixty percent received 4 F-PCC and 40% APCC. The incidence of treatment failure was 28% (12/43). Of the 12 patients with hematoma expansion, only 3 were symptomatic (9.3%). Hematoma expansion with 4 F-PCC and APCC were similar (27% vs. 29%,p = .859). Only sex was associated with hematoma expansion on multivariate analysis [OR (95% CI) = 6.7 (1.1 - 40.9)]. PCC was an effective option for factor Xa inhibitor reversal following TBI. The relationship between radiographic expansion and clinical expansion was poor.",Factor-Xa inhibitor;Prothrombin complex concentrates;Reversal;Traumatic brain injury,trauma

Early traumatic experiences and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in people with eating disorders: A narrative review.,"Exposure to trauma during childhood is a non-specific risk factor for psychiatric disorders, including eating disorders (EDs), over the life course. Moreover, an association between stressful life events and the onset/maintenance of EDs has been documented. Therefore, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, namely the main component of the endogenous stress response system, has been proposed to be implicated in the pathophysiology of EDs. In this narrative review the current knowledge concerning the effects of early trauma exposure on the HPA axis activity and their putative role in the pathophysiology of EDs will be illustrated. Research findings corroborate the idea that childhood trauma exposure has long-lasting dysregulating effects on the activity of the HPA axis, which may contribute to the biological background of the early trauma-related risk for the development of EDs across the life span. Moreover, literature data support the existence of a ""maltreated ecophenotype"" in EDs characterized by specific clinic and neuroendocrine features, which may have important implications in treatment programming for such a type of patients.",Anorexia nervosa;Bulimia nervosa;Childhood maltreatment;Eating disorders;Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis;Stress response,trauma
"Burnout, Moral Distress, and Compassion Fatigue as Correlates of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms in Clinical and Nonclinical Healthcare Workers.","Research has highlighted psychological distress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers (HCWs), including the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, the degree to which these conditions have endured beyond the pandemic and the extent to which they affect the entire healthcare team, including both clinical and nonclinical workers, remain unknown. This study aims to identify correlates of PTSS in the entire healthcare workforce with the goal of providing evidence to support the development of trauma-informed leadership strategies. Data were collected from June to July 2022 using a cross-sectional anonymous survey in a large academic medical center setting. A total of 6,466 clinical and nonclinical employees completed the survey (27.3% response rate). Cases with at least one missing variable were omitted, for a total sample size of 4,806, the evaluation of which enabled us to understand individual, organizational, and work-related and nonwork-related stressors associated with PTSS. Data were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression and dominance analyses to identify predictors of PTSS specific to clinical and nonclinical workers. While previous studies have shown that HCWs in different job roles experience unique stressors, our data indicate that the top correlates of PTSS among both clinical and nonclinical HCWs are the same: burnout, moral distress, and compassion fatigue. These three factors alone explained 45% and 44.4% of the variance in PTSS in clinical and nonclinical workers, respectively. PTSS was also associated with a lower sense of recognition and feeling mistreated by other employees at work in the clinical workforce. Concerningly, women and sexual minorities in the clinical sample exhibited a higher incidence of PTSS. In nonclinical workers, social isolation or loneliness and lower trust and confidence in senior leadership were associated with PTSS. Nonwork-related factors, such as exhaustion from caregiving responsibilities and financial strain, were also significantly associated with PTSS. Even after controlling for discrimination at and outside of work in both samples, we found that non-White populations were more likely to experience PTSS, highlighting a deeply concerning issue in the healthcare workforce. The primary objective of this article is to help healthcare leaders understand the correlates of PTSS across the entire healthcare team as organizations recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding which factors are associated with PTSS will help healthcare leaders develop best practices that aim to reduce HCW distress and strategies to circumvent trauma derived from future crises. Our data indicate that leaders must address the correlates of PTSS in the workforce, focusing attention on both those who work on the frontlines and those who work behind the scenes. We urge leaders to adopt a trauma-informed leadership approach to ensure that the entire healthcare workforce is recognized, supported, and cared for as each HCW plays a unique role in the care of patients.",,trauma

Fusariosis in Mexico: a ten-year retrospective series.,"Fusarium species represent an opportunistic fungal pathogen in patients with an unrelated disease. The data in Mexico about Fusarium infections in humans are scarce. Here, we present a retrospective series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of fusariosis in eight different hospitals in Mexico. The diagnosis of proven fusariosis was made according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORT/MSG) criteria. Forty-nine cases were identified in our series. Most patients had burn injuries (49%) and 37% had hematological malignancy. Most patients had fire injuries (40%), followed by electric injury (8%), febrile neutropenia (10%), and pancytopenia (6%). Patients had skin and soft tissue involvement in 48%, followed by blood culture isolation and biopsies from different sites of the body (lung, sinuses, bone tissue, eyes). Most patients received voriconazole as a single drug therapy (30%), followed by a lipidic formulation of amphotericin B (20%) or conventional amphotericin B (16%). The most common combination therapy was triazole plus a lipidic formulation of amphotericin B (30%). Mortality related to Fusarium infection occurred in 22% of patients. Fusariosis is a serious threat. Burn injuries and hematologic malignancies represent the most common causes of infection in this small series from Mexico.","

"'Intraoperative predictors for clinical outcomes after microinvasive glaucoma surgery"".","To evaluate the clinical applicability of intraoperative predictors for surgical outcomes after gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) and microincisional trabeculectomy (MIT). Consecutive patients with primary, or secondary glaucoma (trauma, aphakic, or status post-retinal surgeries) with uncontrolled IOP>21mm Hg, who were scheduled to undergo GATT or MIT with or without significant cataract surgery, at a tertiary eye centre in East India between September 2021 to March 2023, were included. All surgeries were done by a single surgeon. Blanching and Trypan blue (0.4%) staining after intracameral injection using a 25 canula, were analysed in each video. The extent/pattern of blanching and blue staining in each eye was analysed objectively using an overlay of a circle with 12 sectors and a protractor tool to quantify the degrees or quadrants of blanching/staining. Multivariate regression was used to identify predictors for surgical success or the need for medications after surgery. Of 167 eyes that were included (male: female- 134: 33), 49 eyes and 118 eyes underwent GATT and MIT, respectively, with 81 of 167 eyes undergoing concurrent cataract surgery. All eyes had a significant reduction in the number of medications after surgery. Blanching was seen in 154 of 167 eyes in a mean of 2±1.8 quadrants with 41% of eyes showing a blanching effect in >3 quadrants. Of 99 of 167 eyes where Trypan blue staining was assessed, staining in a venular, diffuse haze, or reticular pattern of staining was seen in 73 eyes, 26 eyes showed blue staining in >2 quadrants, with 16% staining in >3 quadrants. Surgical success was not predicted by the quadrants of blanching, blue staining, or other clinical variables (age, visual field, baseline intraocular pressure, type of surgery). The variables significantly predicting the need for medications included blanch (r = -0.1, p = 0.03), and blue staining (r = -0.1, p = 0.04) in <2 quadrants. Blanching and Trypan blue staining in >2 quadrants after GATT or MIT can serve as surrogate predictors for the need for medications. However more studies are mandated to find predictors for surgical success after GATT or MIT.",,trauma
Prevalence of recent occupational injury and its associated factors among food industry workers in Selangor.,"Malaysia's gross domestic product is heavily influenced by the food and beverage sector and the contribution of the industry to the national economy is expected to increase in the coming years. Thus, the need for employees in the food industry will continue to rise as this sector grows. Nevertheless, employees in the food industry are exposed to various occupational hazards that can lead to occupational injuries, mainly related to kitchen work. Given the increasing number of employees in the food industry and the rising trend of occupational injuries, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of recent occupational injuries and their associated factors and predictors among food industry workers. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2023 among food industry workers in Selangor, Malaysia. The respondents were sampled using a multistage random sampling method. Data were collected via online self-administered questionnaires and analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models in the SPSS software, version 25. A total of 250 responses were received from 342 samples, with an overall response rate of 73.0%. The prevalence of recent occupational injuries among food industry workers was 44.8%. Statistically, significant associations were present between occupational injuries and alcohol consumption (p = 0.001), poor knowledge (p = 0.031), poor compliance (p = 0.021), poor safety management (p = 0.021), poor safety training (p = 0.002), poor safety culture (p = 0.003), physical exposure (p < 0.001), and ergonomic exposure (p = 0.009). The predictors for recent occupational injuries among food industry workers were Malay (adjusted Odds Ratio; aOR = 2.60, p = 0.027, 95% Confidence Interval; CI = 1.116, 6.035), alcohol consumption (aOR = 5.31, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 2.042, 13.779), poor knowledge (aOR = 1.98, p = 0.032, 95% CI = 1.059, 3.691), poor safety culture (aOR = 2.44, p = 0.002, 95% CI = 1.372, 4.342), and exposure to physical hazards (aOR = 8.88, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 3.031, 26.014). This study has found a high prevalence of occupational injuries among food industry workers, thereby highlighting the importance of addressing alcohol consumption, improving worker knowledge, enhancing work safety culture, and better control measures on exposure to physical hazards, especially among Malay workers. By prioritising these factors, employers can create safer work environments and minimise the risk of occupational injuries.",,trauma
Variations in Management of Zone 1 Open Globe Injuries Across Corneal Specialists.,"The aim of this study was to describe variations in practice patterns for the management of zone 1 open globe injuries among corneal specialists worldwide. This cross-sectional study was performed using an online survey distributed to members of The Cornea Society. Responses were collected between September 9, 2021, and September 30, 2021. Of 94 responses included in analysis, respondents averaged 18.2 ± 14.5 years of postfellowship experience. Among respondents, 53 (56.4%) were affiliated with an academic institution and 41 (43.6%) with private practice. Ophthalmologists practicing in the United States were significantly more likely to use an eye shield preoperatively (98.5% vs. 85.7%, P = 0.03) and less likely to perform primary lensectomy in cases of lens involvement (40.9% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.002) compared with those practicing outside the United States. Ophthalmologists in practice fewer than 10 years were more likely to administer preoperative systemic antibiotics (91.4% vs. 66.1%, P = 0.006) and tetanus prophylaxis (88.6% vs. 67.8%, P = 0.03), and to obtain preoperative computed tomography scans (85.7% vs. 54.2%, P = 0.002) compared with more senior physicians. Ophthalmologists at academic institutions were more likely to perform preoperative B-scan (30.2% vs. 9.8%, P = 0.02), use general anesthesia (90.6% vs. 70.7%, P = 0.03), and admit for postoperative antibiotics (28.3% vs. 9.8%, P = 0.04), and were less likely to perform surgery overnight (45.3% vs. 70.7%, P = 0.02) compared with private practice physicians. There is significant variation in the practice patterns for the management of zone 1 open globe injuries among corneal specialists, which presents an opportunity to investigate whether certain treatment options lead to better outcomes in these injuries.",,trauma
Pediatric Ribs at Chest Radiography: Normal Variants and Abnormalities.,"Normal variants and abnormalities of the ribs are frequently encountered on chest radiographs. Accurate identification of normal variants is crucial to avoid unnecessary investigations. A meticulous evaluation of rib abnormalities can provide valuable insights into the patient's symptoms, and even when no osseous condition is suspected, rib abnormalities may offer critical clues to underlying conditions. Rib abnormalities are associated with various conditions, including benign tumors, malignant tumors, infectious and inflammatory conditions, vascular abnormalities, metabolic disorders, nonaccidental injuries, malformation syndromes, and bone dysplasias. Abnormalities of the ribs are classified into three groups based on their radiographic patterns: focal, multifocal, and diffuse changes. Focal lesions are further subdivided into nonaggressive lesions, aggressive lesions, and infectious and inflammatory disorders. Radiologists should be aware of individual disorders of the pediatric ribs, including their imaging findings, relevant clinical information, and underlying pathogenesis. Differential diagnoses are addressed as appropriate. Since chest radiographs can suffice for diagnosis in certain cases, the authors emphasize a pattern recognition approach to radiographic interpretation. However, additional cross-sectional imaging may be necessary for focal lesions such as tumors or inflammatory conditions. Awareness of disease-specific imaging findings helps ascertain the nature of the lesion and directs appropriate management. ©RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.",,trauma

We discuss how sportomics can be used to comprehend the multilevel metabolism during exercise in real-life conditions faced by athletes, enabling potential personalized interventions to improve performance and recovery and reduce injuries, all with a minimally invasive approach and reduced time. Sportomics may also support highly personalized investigations, including the implementation of n-of-1 clinical trials and the curation of extensive datasets through long-term follow-up of athletes, enabling tailored interventions for athletes based on their unique physiological responses to different conditions. Beyond its immediate sport-related applications, we delve into the potential of utilizing the sportomics approach to translate Big Data regarding top-level athletes into studying different human diseases, especially with nontargeted analysis. Furthermore, we present how the amalgamation of bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and integrative computational analysis aids in investigating biochemical pathways, and facilitates the search for various biomarkers. We also highlight how sportomics can offer relevant information about doping control analysis.

"Untargeted metagenomic sequencing identifies Toscana virus in patients with idiopathic meningitis, southern Spain, 2015 to 2019.","BackgroundVarious pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses can lead to meningitis. Among viruses causing meningitis, Toscana virus (TOSV), a phlebovirus, is transmitted through sandfly bites. TOSV infection may be suspected if patients with enterovirus- and herpesvirus-negative aseptic (non-bacterial) meningitis recall recent insect bites. Other epidemiological factors (season, rural area) may be considered. The broad range of possible meningitis aetiologies poses considerable diagnosis challenges. Untargeted metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) can potentially identify pathogens, which are not considered or detected in routine diagnostic panels.AimIn this retrospective, single-centre observational study, we investigated mNGS usefulness to understand the cause of meningitis when conventional approaches fail.MethodsCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients hospitalised in southern Spain in 2015-2019 with aseptic meningitis and no aetiology found by conventional testing, were subjected to mNGS. Patients' demographic characteristics had been recorded and physicians had asked them about recent insect bites. Obtained viral genome sequences were phylogenetically analysed.ResultsAmong 23 idiopathic cases, TOSV was identified in eight (all male; median age:  39 years, range: 15-78 years). Five cases lived in an urban setting, three occurred in autumn and only one recalled insect bites. Phylogenetic analysis of TOSV segment sequences supported one intra-genotype reassortment event.ConclusionsOur study highlights the usefulness of mNGS for identifying viral pathogens directly in CSF. In southern Spain, TOSV should be considered regardless of recalling of insect bites or other epidemiological criteria. Detection of a disease-associated reassortant TOSV emphasises the importance of monitoring the spread and evolution of phleboviruses in Mediterranean countries.",D006801:Humans;D008297:Male;D000328:Adult;D029301:Sandfly fever Naples virus;D007299:Insect Bites and Stings;D010802:Phylogeny;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D013030:Spain;D008581:Meningitis,trauma

Recent research conducted within the past 3 years highlights the effectiveness of art therapy as an intervention strategy within Syrian child and adolescent refugee populations. These studies emphasize that art therapy offers a safe and supportive space for these young refugees to express emotions, process trauma, and improve their psychological well-being. It has shown promise in mitigating trauma-related challenges and fostering resilience among this group of refugee populations. Furthermore, art therapy plays a crucial role in preserving cultural identities and has proven to be versatile and adaptable to various artistic modalities. These findings underscore the potential of art therapy as a valuable tool for supporting the mental well-being and resilience of Syrian children and adolescent refugees, warranting further exploration and integration into their care and support programs. Recent studies on the use of art therapy within Syrian child and adolescent refugee communities reveal its potential as a powerful intervention strategy for enhancing mental well-being and resilience in this vulnerable population. The review identifies six key themes, highlighting the therapeutic benefits and versatility of art therapy. As we move forward, these findings offer promising future directions for research and practice in art therapy with this specific group of refugees, emphasizing the need for continued exploration and integration of this approach in supporting Syrian child and adolescent refugees.",Art therapy;Critical review;Cultural identity;Intervention;Mental well-being;Refugees;Resilience;Syrian children and adolescents;Trauma,trauma
Underreported and underrecognized: a comprehensive imaging review of breast injury.,"Breast injury is commonly encountered yet it remains significantly underreported. Injury to the breast may arise from either primary mechanisms or secondary or iatrogenic mechanisms. Primary mechanisms of breast injury include blunt force, seat-belt, penetrating, and thermal injury. Secondary or iatrogenic mechanisms of breast injury include breast biopsy or intervention as well as operative intervention and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The severity of breast injury arising from these mechanisms is broad, ranging from breast contusion to avulsion. Sequelae of breast injury include fat necrosis and Mondor's disease. Radiologists play an integral role in the evaluation and management of breast injury both in the acute and non-acute settings. In the acute setting, radiologists must be able to recognize breast injury arising from primary mechanisms or iatrogenic or secondary mechanisms and to identify rare but potentially life-threatening complications promptly to ensure timely, appropriate management. In the non-acute setting, radiologists must be able to discern the sequalae of breast injury from other processes to prevent potentially unnecessary further evaluation and intervention. Nonetheless, though breast injury is commonly encountered there remain few guidelines and a lack of established recommendations for the evaluation and management of breast injury. We provide a comprehensive multi-modality imaging review of breast injury arising in the acute setting as well as the sequela of breast injury arising in the non-acute setting. Moreover, we provide an overview of the management of breast injury.",Breast injury;Breast trauma;Imaging review,trauma
11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1) gene expression in muscle is linked to reduced skeletal muscle index in sarcopenic patients.,"Glucocorticoids play a significant role in metabolic processes and pathways that impact muscle size, mass, and function. The expression of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1) has been previously described as a major regulator of skeletal muscle function in glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy and aging humans. Our study aimed to investigate glucocorticoid metabolism, including the expression of HSD11B1 in skeletal muscle, in patients with sarcopenia. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of thirty-three patients over 60 years of age with hip fractures. Sarcopenia status was assessed according to the criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2. Skeletal muscle mass was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Cortisol and cortisone concentrations were measured in serum. Gene expression analysis of HSD11B1, NR3C1, FBXO32, and TRIM63 in muscle biopsies was performed. Serial cross sections of skeletal muscle were labeled with myosin heavy chain slow (fiber type-1) and fast (fiber type-2) antibodies. The study included 33 patients (21 women) with a mean age of 82.5 ± 6.3 years, 17 patients revealed sarcopenic (n = 16 non-sarcopenic). Serum cortisone concentrations were negatively correlated with muscle mass (ß =  - 0.425; p = 0.034) and type-2 fiber diameter (ß =  - 0.591; p = 0.003). Gene expression of HSD11B1 (ß =  - 0.673; p = 0.008) showed a negative correlation with muscle mass in the sarcopenic group. A significant correlation was found for the non-sarcopenic group for NR3C1 (ß = 0.548; p = 0.028) and muscle mass. These findings suggest a pathogenetic role of HSD11B1 in sarcopenic muscle.",FBXO32;Glucocorticoids;HSD11B1;NR3C1;Sarcopenia;TRIM63,trauma
Distal Kaplan fibers and anterolateral ligament injuries are associated with greater intra-articular internal tibial rotation in ACL-deficient knees based on magnetic resonance imaging.,"The purpose of the present study was to assess the internal rotation of the tibia on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in a series of consecutive athletes with Anterior cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed to include all consecutive patients who had undergone primary ACL reconstruction between January 2022 and June 2022. The angle between surgical epicondylar axes (SEA) of the knee and posterior tibial condyles (PTC) was measured. A negative value was defined as internal torsion. KFs and ALL injuries were reported. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to examine the independent associations between SEA-PTC angle and injuries of KFs and ALL adjusted for physical variables (age, gender and body mass index [BMI]). Statistical significance was set at a p-value of < 0.05. A total of 83 eligible patients were included. The result of multiple linear regression analysis showed that internal tibial rotation was associated with KFs and ALL injuries. The estimated average of SEA-PTC angle in relation to ALL injuries controlling the other variables was -5.49 [95%CI -6.79 - (-4.18)] versus -2.99 [95%CI -4.55 - (-1.44)] without ALL injuries. On the other hand, the estimated average of SEA-PTC angle in relation to KFs lesions controlling the other variables was -5.73 [95%CI -7.04 - (-4.43)] versus -2.75 [95%CI -4.31 - (-1.18)] without KFs injuries. KFs and ALL injuries were associated with an increased intra-articular internal tibial rotation in ACL-deficient knees. The measurement of femorotibial rotation on axial MRI could be useful to detect indirect signs of anterolateral complex (ALC) injuries.",ACL;Anterolateral complex;Anterolateral ligament;Internal tibial rotation;Kaplan fibers injuries;MRI,trauma
[Prehospital treatment of polytrauma : Ongoing challenge in prehospital emergency services].,"Tscherne was the first to define the term polytrauma in 1966 as ""multiple injuries to different regions of the body sustained simultaneously, with at least one injury or the combination of these injuries being life-threatening"". This definition highlights the essential pathophysiological paradigm of polytrauma, with the life-threating characteristics resulting from injuries to multiple organ systems. The treatment of polytrauma patients begins at the scene of the accident. Important life-saving initial interventions can already be carried out on site through targeted measures and expertise of the emergency medical service team, thus improving patient survival. The advanced trauma life support/prehospital trauma life support (ATLS/PHTLS) concept is the worldwide gold standard. As prehospital treatment of severely injured patients is not routine for most emergency teams, concepts and emergency interventions must be regularly trained. This is the prerequisite for safe and effective emergency treatment in this time-critical situation.",Emergency medicine;Hemorrhage;Life support care;Resuscitation;Shock,trauma
Surgical fixation of distal ulna neck and head fractures.,"Distal ulna plate fixation for ulnar neck and head fractures (excluding ulnar styloid fractures) aims to anatomically reduce the distal ulna fracture (DUF) by open reduction and internal fixation, while obtaining a stable construct allowing functional rehabilitation without need for cast immobilization. Severe displacement, angulation or translation, as well as unstable or intra-articular fractures. Furthermore, multiple trauma or young patients in need of quick functional rehabilitation. Inability to surgically address concomitant ipsilateral extremity fractures, thus, limiting early active rehabilitation. Stable, nondisplaced fractures. Need for bridging plate or external fixator of distal radiocarpal joint. An ulnar approach, with a straight incision between the extensor and flexor carpi ulnaris. Preservation of the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. Reduction and plate fixation with avoidance of plate impingement in the articular zone. Postoperatively, an elastic bandage is applied for the first 24-48 h. In isolated DUF with stable fixation, a postoperative splint is often unnecessary and should be avoided. For the first four weeks, only light weightbearing of everyday activities is allowed to protect the osteosynthesis. Thereafter, heavier weightbearing and activities are allowed and can be increased as tolerated. The best available evidence likely shows that for younger patients with a DUF, with or without concomitant distal radius fractures, open reduction and internal fixation can be safely achieved with good functional outcome and acceptable union and complication rates as long as proper technique is ensured.",Distal radioulnar joint;Distal ulna fracture;Early active motion;Internal fixation;Surgical outcome,trauma
Management of radiology services during the 2022 FIFA football (soccer) World Cup.,"Diagnostic imaging is the predominant medical service sought for the assessment and staging of musculoskeletal injuries in professional sports events. During the 2022 FIFA Football (soccer) World Cup, a centralized medical care infrastructure was established. This article provides a comprehensive account of the radiological services implemented during this event, encompassing the deployment of equipment and human resources, the structuring of workflows to uphold athlete confidentiality, and initiatives aimed at enhancing communication. Communication channels were refined through radiology consultations held with national teams' health care providers and the adoption of audiovisual reports available in multiple languages, which could be accessed remotely by team physicians. Our established framework can be replicated in international professional football events for seamless integration and efficacy.",Audiovisual report;FIFA;Football;Management;Musculoskeletal;Radiology;Radiology report;Soccer,trauma
Invasive Brain Computer Interface for Motor Restoration in Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review.,"Systematic review of the literature. In recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) has emerged as a potential treatment for patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). This is the first systematic review of the literature on invasive closed-loop BCI technologies for the treatment of SCI in humans. A comprehensive search of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Ovid EMBASE was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Of 8316 articles collected, 19 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Data from 21 patients were extracted from these studies. All patients sustained a cervical SCI and were treated using either a BCI with intracortical microelectrode arrays (n = 18, 85.7%) or electrocorticography (n = 3, 14.3%). To decode these neural signals, machine learning and statistical models were used: support vector machine in eight patients (38.1%), linear estimator in seven patients (33.3%), Hidden Markov Model in three patients (14.3%), and other in three patients (14.3%). As the outputs, ten patients (47.6%) underwent noninvasive functional electrical stimulation (FES) with a cuff; one (4.8%) had an invasive FES with percutaneous stimulation, and ten (47.6%) used an external device (neuroprosthesis or virtual avatar). Motor function was restored in all patients for each assigned task. Clinical outcome measures were heterogeneous across all studies. Invasive techniques of BCI show promise for the treatment of SCI, but there is currently no technology that can restore complete functional autonomy in patients with SCI. The current techniques and outcomes of BCI vary greatly. Because invasive BCIs are still in the early stages of development, further clinical studies should be conducted to optimize the prognosis for patients with SCI.",Brain-computer interfaces;electrocorticography;microelectrodes;spinal cord injuries;systematic review,trauma
Status epilepticus in BRAF-related cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome: focus on neuroimaging clues to physiopathology.,"Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS) is a genetic disorder due to variants affecting genes coding key proteins of the Ras/MAPK signalling pathway. Among the different features of CFCS, neurological involvement, including cerebral malformations and epilepsy, represents a common and clinically relevant aspect. Status epilepticus (SE) is a recurrent feature, especially in a specific subgroup of CFCS patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and history of severe pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Here we dissect the features of SE in CFCS patients with a particular focus on longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to identify clinical-radiological patterns, and discuss the underlying physiopathology. We retrospectively analysed clinical, electroencephalogram (EEG) and MRI data collected in a single centre from a cohort of 23 patients with CFCS carrying pathogenic BRAF variants who experienced SE during a 5-year period. Seven episodes of SE were documented in 5 CFCS patients who underwent EEG and MRI at baseline. MRI was performed during SE/within 72 hours from SE termination in 5/7 events. Acute/early post-ictal MRI findings showed heterogenous abnormalities: restricted diffusion in 2/7, focal area of pcASL perfusion change in 2/7, focal cortical T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in 2/7. Follow-up images were available for 4/7 SE. No acute changes were detected in 2/7 (MRI performed 4 days after SE termination). Acute focal neuroimaging changes concomitant with ictal EEG focus were present in 5/7 episodes, though with different findings. The heterogeneous patterns suggest different contributing factors, possibly including the presence of focal cortical malformations and autoinflammation. When cytotoxic oedema is revealed by MRI, it can be followed by permanent structural damage, as already observed in other genetic conditions. A better understanding of the physiopathology will provide access to targeted treatments allowing to prevent long-term adverse neurological outcome.",BRAF;Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome;focal brain oedema;status epilepticus,trauma
Prolonged Inflammatory Reaction to Fractured Calcium Phosphate Cement Cranioplasty Secondary to Sequestration Within the Diploe.,"Calcium phosphate cement remains the choice biomaterial for cranial reconstruction and augmentation in pediatric patients after 90% completion of cranial growth, especially compared with other nonallograft alternatives. While trauma to the site of calcium phosphate augmentation is a known risk for cement fracture, subsequent micro-fragmentation and sequestration of the cement beneath the fracture site can produce a localized inflammatory reaction that requires surgical intervention to adequately address. The authors present the course of a patient undergoing a prolonged inflammatory reaction to calcium phosphate micro-fragmentation after trauma to the site of previous augmentation performed to mend bitemporal hollowing. Cement microfragmentation and migration through an associated nondisplaced fracture of the outer table required extensive debridement of the underlying diploe before the resolution was achieved. This case illustrates the need for appropriate evaluation in cases of trauma to areas with cement to mitigate the need for extensive surgical management.",,trauma
Magnesium-Organic Framework-Loaded Bisphosphonate-Functionalized Gel Scaffolds for Enhanced Bone Regeneration.,"The development of magnesium-derived biomaterials is one of the most promising research in bone tissue engineering, and related strategies have been extensively used for tendon, skull, cartilage, and bone regeneration. Also, alendronate, a well-recognized drug for osteoporosis treatment, has recently attracted a great deal of attention for bone repair. However, rapid corrosion in vivo of Mg2+ and low systemic bioavailability of alendronate are the main limitations hampering their full exploitation. In this work, by means of physical and chemical cross-linking conjugating magnesium-metal-organic frameworks (Mg-MOFs) and bone-targeting alendronate to biocompatible gelatin scaffolds, a facile method is developed for the preparation of organic/inorganic nanocomposite gel scaffolds. The results affirmed that the nanocomposite gel scaffolds possessed excellent biocompatibility, continuous slow release of Mg2+ and alendronate, strong bone affinity, and bone regeneration. It is noteworthy that the continuous slow release of Mg2+ and alendronate could induce the macrophage switch to the M2 phenotype and promote osteogenic differentiation in the early stage, resulting in improved bone regeneration during implanting the scaffolds into the distal femoral. In summary, Mg-MOFs-loaded alendronate-modified gelatin gel scaffolds have been developed, exhibiting great potential for bone regenerative.",alendronate;bone regenerative;gel scaffold;gelatin;magnesium,trauma

Shame and Emotion Dysregulation as Pathways to Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Among Women With a History of Interpersonal Trauma.,"Women who have survived interpersonal trauma are at elevated risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and potentially modifiable factors that may be targeted in treatment warrant further investigation. This study examined a pathway from interpersonal trauma to PTSD symptoms via emotion dysregulation and shame in a large non-clinical sample of women. The sample comprised 380 women, aged 18 to 59 years (M = 31.70, standard deviation = 10.06), all of whom had a history of interpersonal trauma. Participants completed the Experience of Shame Scale, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form, and the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5. A serial and parallel process model with interpersonal trauma as a predictor of PTSD symptoms, emotional dysregulation and facets of shame as intermediary variables, was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Statistics PROCESS Model 81with bias-corrected bootstrap tests of indirect effects. Non-interpersonal trauma was included as a covariate. Interpersonal trauma, emotion dysregulation, and characterological and bodily shame were significantly and directly associated with PTSD symptoms, together explaining 59% of the variation in PTSD symptoms. While emotion dysregulation was associated with behavioral shame, interpersonal trauma was not associated with behavioral shame, nor was behavioral shame associated with PTSD symptoms. Tests of indirect effects supported a pathway from interpersonal trauma to PTSD symptoms via emotion dysregulation and characterological and bodily shame. These findings suggest interventions that are particularly effective at reducing emotion dysregulation and characterological and bodily shame, such as compassion and acceptance-based approaches, may complement evidence-based PTSD interventions when working with women who have survived interpersonal trauma.",PTSD;emotion dysregulation;interpersonal trauma;posttraumatic stress disorder;shame;women,trauma
Resilience and traumatic childhood experiences of patients with opioid use disorder.,"We aim to explore childhood traumatic experiences and resilience of patients with OUD and compare these variables to healthy controls. Ninety-five patients and 83 healthy controls completed the Sociodemographic Data Form, Connor Davidson Psychological Resilience Scale (CDRS), and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-33 (CTQ-33). We found that CTQ correlated negatively with CDRS in patients. T-test results showed significant differences between both groups regarding total and subscales' scores of CTQ-except overprotection-over control. Physical neglect predicted a decrease in resilience in patients with OUD. In conclusion, childhood traumas and resilience could be essential factors during patients' follow-up and treatment process with OUD.",Early life stress;opioid use disorder;psychological resilience;traumatic childhood experiences,trauma
Glanzmann's thrombasthenia associated with gastrointestinal angiodysplasias successfully treated with bevacizumab.,"Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare hemorrhagic condition caused by a platelet surface receptor disorder of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa. Symptoms of GT are various forms of hemorrhages, such as purpura, epistaxis and menorrhagia. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a rare expression of the condition and may occur due to traumas in the GI tract or as a consequence of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia (GIADs). In this case report, we present a middle-aged woman with recurrent GIB consequent to GIADs with persistent melena and iron deficiency anemia. After several unsuccessful therapeutic interventions, the patient was studied by the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia's (HHT - Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) unit, where she received bevacizumab, showing a complete improvement in symptoms as well as a reduction in her GIADs. This case shows that bevacizumab could be a possible line of treatment for patients with coagulation disorders with GIADs.",D006801:Humans;D008875:Middle Aged;D005260:Female;D013915:Thrombasthenia;D000068258:Bevacizumab;D019039:Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex;D008595:Menorrhagia;D001791:Blood Platelet Disorders;D006471:Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage;D035583:Rare Diseases;D016888:Angiodysplasia,trauma
"Combination of aspirin and rosuvastatin for reduction of venous thromboembolism in severely injured patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic randomized phase II clinical trial (The STAT Trial).","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant source of postinjury morbidity and mortality. Beta-hydroxy beta-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (rosuvastatin) significantly reduced pathologic clotting events in healthy populations in a prior trial. Furthermore, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been shown to be noninferior to prophylactic heparinoids for VTE prevention following orthopedic surgery. We hypothesized that a combination of rosuvastatin/ASA, in addition to standard VTE chemoprophylaxis, would reduce VTE in critically ill trauma patients. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, evaluating VTE rates in two groups: ASA + statin (Experimental) and identical placebos (Control). Injured adults, 18-65 years old, admitted to the surgical intensive care unit without contraindications for VTE prophylaxis were eligible. Upon initiation of routine VTE chemoprophylaxis (i.e. heparin/heparin-derivatives), they were randomized to the Experimental or Control group. VTE was the primary outcome. Of 112 potentially eligible patients, 33% (n = 37, median new injury severity scale = 27) were successfully randomized, of whom 11% had VTEs. The Experimental group had no VTEs, while the Control group had 6 VTEs (4 PEs and 2 DVTs) in 4 (22%) patients (P = 0.046). The Experimental treatment was not associated with any serious adverse events. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was interrupted at the second interim analysis at <10% of the planned enrollment, with significance declared at P < 0.012 at that stage. The combination of ASA and rosuvastatin with standard VTE prophylaxis showed a favorable trend toward reducing VTEs with no serious adverse events. An appropriately powered phase III multicenter trial is needed to further investigate this therapeutic approach.

"Worldwide burden and trends of diabetes among people aged 70 years and older, 1990-2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","Diabetes places a significant burden on personal and public health. However, a comprehensive assessment of the burden of diabetes in older adults is lacking. We aimed to estimate the global burden of diabetes and explore trends for the population aged ≥70 from 1990 to 2019. Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, the prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of diabetes among people aged ≥70 were estimated by sex and age group in 2019. We also assessed the epidemiological trend of diabetes from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, 110.1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 101.2-119.4) people aged ≥70 years were living with diabetes (types 1 and 2 combined) with a global prevalence of 23.7% (21.8%-25.8%). Worldwide, 181.9 deaths (163.0-194.7) per 100,000 population and 4512.3 DALYs (3861.3-5264.2) per 100,000 population occurred due to diabetes. In 2019, minor sex-related disparities in the burden of diabetes were identified among specific age and sex groups. From 1990 to 2019, the prevalence of diabetes increased by 39.7% (37.7%-41.7%), and the related mortality and DALY rates also increased (16.4% [9.43%-22.9%] and 22.3% [17.2%-27.0%], respectively). The global burden of diabetes in adults aged ≥70 has increased markedly from 1990 to 2019. As the population continues to age, there is an urgent need to combat the increasing disease burden.",aged (70+);diabetes;disability-adjusted life-year;mortality;prevalence,trauma
Position of the anterior ethmoidal foramen and trauma to the cranial base during transconjunctival medial orbital decompression: a systematic literature review.,"To review the literature on the location of the anterior ethmoidal foramen (AEF) and trauma during transconjunctival medial wall decompression. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases, combining the terms ""olfactory fossa"" and ""fovea ethmoidalis"" with ""trauma,"" ""cerebrospinal fluid leak,"" ""pneumocephalus,"" ""orbital decompression,"" and ""anterior ethmoidal artery"" (AEA). All cases of cranial base trauma during medial orbital decompression and the anatomical studies on the location of the AEF and the course of the AEA were reviewed. Ninety-four articles were identified, of which 37 were related to the AEF, 41 reported the course of the AEA, and 16 to reported cases of cranial base trauma. Out of these cases, 10 were related to transconjunctival medial orbital decompression, affecting 11 patients. Most AEFs are situated at the frontoethmoidal suture, but up to 38.15% of AEFs are located above the suture on the frontal bone. Most AEFs are adjacent to the roof of the ethmoidal sinus. The distance of the AEF to the cranial base increases in the presence of supraorbital ethmoidal cells (SOEC). The position of the AEF is variable and should not be considered a safe landmark for all patients.",Anterior ethmoidal foramen;anterior ethmoidal artery;cranial base trauma;medial orbital decompression;olfactory fossa,trauma
Pain in the Gut: An Intriguing Case of Toothpick Ingestion Causing Gastric Perforation.,"Toothpick ingestion is a medical emergency requiring urgent intervention. Swallowed toothpicks can cause intestinal perforation, bleeding, or damage to the surrounding organs. Herein, we describe a unique case of a geriatric patient with a history of peptic ulcer disease who presented to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain and nausea. Gastric wall thickening concerning for a gastric neoplasm was observed on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed an embedded toothpick with a contained gastric perforation, and the foreign body was retrieved with a grasper device. Given the rare presentation, nonspecific symptoms, inability to recall, and often inconclusive imaging, a high index of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis and treatment of toothpick ingestion.","D006801:Humans;D000368:Aged;D015746:Abdominal Pain;D005547:Foreign Bodies;D014057:Tomography, X-Ray Computed;D013270:Stomach;D004435:Eating",trauma
Antimicrobial Mechanisms and Preparation of Antibiotic-impregnated Cement-coated Locking Plates in the Treatment of Infected Non-unions.,"Antibiotic-impregnated cement-coated plates (ACPs) have been used successfully for temporary internal fixation between stages in the two-stage treatment of infected non-unions. We describe our approach of using an ACP in the staged treatment of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-infected distal femoral non-union below a total hip prosthesis. In addition, we present the results of an in vitro experiment to provide an in-depth insight into the capacity of ACPs in (i) treating residual biofilm and (ii) preventing bacterial recolonisation. In the first stage, we used a titanium LISS plate coated with hand-mixed PALACOS with vancomycin (PAL-V) for temporary internal fixation combined with commercially prepared COPAL with gentamicin and vancomycin (COP-GV) to fill the segmental defect. In the second stage, the non-union was treated with double-plate fixation and bone grafting.A Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion assay was performed to determine the antimicrobial activity of both ACPs and a drug-release assay to measure antibiotic release over time. A biofilm killing assay was also carried out to determine if the antibiotic released was able to reduce or eradicate biofilm of the patient's MRSA strain. At one-year follow-up, there was complete bone-bridging across the previous non-union. The patient was pain-free and ambulatory without need for further surgery. Both ACPs with COP-GV and PAL-V exerted an antimicrobial effect against the MRSA strain with peak concentrations of antibiotic released within the first 24 hours. Concentrations released from COP-GV in the first 24 hours in vitro caused a 7.7-fold log reduction of colony-forming units (CFU) in the biofilm. At day 50, both COP-GV and PAL-V still released concentrations of antibiotic above the respective minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), likely contributing to the positive clinical outcome. The use of an ACP provides stability and infection control in the clinical scenario of an infected non-union. This is confirmed in vitro where the release of antibiotics from ACPs is characterised by an early burst followed by a prolonged sustained release above the MIC until 50 days. The burst release from COP-GV reduces CFU in the biofilm and prevents early recolonisation through synergistic activity of the released vancomycin and gentamicin. An antibiotic-impregnated cement-coated plate is a useful addition to the surgeon's armamentarium to provide temporary internal fixation without the disadvantages of external fixation and contribute to infection control in an infected non-union.

Precice Stryde® Magnetic Internal Lengthening Nail does not Impair Bone Healing Despite Radiographic and Clinical Symptoms.,"The Precice Stryde® internal magnetic lengthening nail allowed many patients a full weight-bearing experience during femur and tibia lengthening, but concerns over corrosion, pain and radiographic changes led to the implant's recall. Despite the recall, it is important to understand the rate of these occurrences and their influence on the overall success of the lengthening procedure. We aimed to investigate radiographic changes, patient-reported symptoms and bone healing indices for our cohort of Stryde lengthening. Our surgical database and electronic medical record system were used to review and document patient demographics, indications for lengthening, length achieved, bone healing index (BHI), location and type of radiographic changes, time until radiographic changes were first visible, presence of pain symptoms (not attributable to surgery or distraction), time to implant removal and if the pain symptoms resolved following implant extraction. From January 2019 to February 2021, 90 Stryde nails (78 femur and 12 tibia) were implanted in 63 patients. The cohort included 48 males and 15 females. The average length [± standard deviation (SD)] achieved was 58.4 ± 22.7 mm. The 66 bones (73%) developed radiographic changes and were found to be 58/78 (74%) femurs and 8/12 (67%) tibias. The average time to initial radiographic changes was 168 ± 108.1 days (femur) and 276 ± 126.8 days (tibia). Late-onset pain developed in 10 femur lengthening (11.1% of all nails) surgeries across eight patients (12.7% of all patients). All patients' pain resolved; three instances prior to nail removal and the remaining seven after nail removal. No patients were re-presented with worsening pain or radiographic changes following implant removal. Radiographic or symptomatic abnormalities did not impair bone formation. The BHI for femurs with (29.6 ± 16.6 days/cm, n = 58) vs without (29.4 ± 17.9 days/cm, n = 20) radiographic or symptomatic irregularity were nearly identical (p = 0.961). The difference between BHI for tibias with (39.3 ± 7.8 days/cm, n = 8) vs without (86.1 ± 38.2 days/cm, n = 4) radiographic changes was influenced by outliers and underpowered to draw a conclusion. Bone lengthening with the Stryde nail was associated with high rates of radiographic abnormalities, but symptoms were uncommon and resolved with explantation. The radiographic changes did not affect bone healing in the femur. Radiographic changes including bone hypertrophy and osteolysis were common after bone lengthening with the Stryde nail, but the development of pain following consolidation was rare and resolved with implant removal.The BHI in femurs was not affected by radiographic changes.

Blunt Vascular Trauma in the Lower Extremity at a Major Trauma Centre: Salvage Rate and Complications.,"Blunt trauma of the lower limb with vascular injury can cause devastating outcomes, including loss of limb and even loss of life. The primary aim of this study was to determine the limb salvage rate of patients sustaining such injuries when treated at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) since becoming a Major Trauma Centre (MTC). The secondary aim was to establish patient complications. A retrospective analysis found that from 2013 to 2018, 30 patients, comprising of 32 injured limbs, were treated for blunt trauma to the lower limb associated with vascular injury. Twenty-four patients were male and six were female. Their mean ages were 32 and 49, respectively. Three limbs were deemed unsalvageable and underwent primary amputation; of the remaining 29 potentially salvageable limbs, 27 (93%) were saved. Median ischaemic times for both amputees and salvaged limbs were under 6 hours. Of the 32 limbs, 27 (84%) were salvaged. All amputees had a MESS score ≥ 7, although not all patients with MESS ≥ 7 required amputation. Eleven limbs had prophylactic fasciotomies, three limbs developed compartment syndrome - all successfully treated and three contracted deep infections - one of which necessitated amputation. All but one patient survived their injuries and were discharged from the hospital. Attempted salvage of 27/29 (93%) limbs was successful and all but one patient survived these injuries when treated at an MTC. MESS scoring and ischaemic time are useful but not sole predictors of limb salvage. Complication rates are low but may be significant for their future implications.

Re-use of Motorised Intramedullary Limb Lengthening Nails.,"This study reviews the re-use of implanted motorised intramedullary lengthening nails previously used for limb lengthening. A retrospective review was performed on the re-use of motorised intramedullary lengthening nails. All patients had a magnetically controlled intramedullary lengthening nail in the femur, tibia, or humerus previously utilised for either lengthening or compression. Patients were included if the magnetically controlled intramedullary lengthening nail underwent attempted re-use either in the same lengthening episode or in a temporally separate lengthening treatment requiring another corticotomy. Ten patients with 12 lengthening episodes were analysed including five tibial, five femoral and two humeral segments. Overall, seven of 12 nails (58%) were successfully re-deployed without the need for nail exchange. Two of three nails were successfully retracted and re-used for continued distraction in the same lengthening treatment. Five of nine nails (56%) were successfully reactivated in a subsequent, later lengthening episode. Re-use of a magnetically controlled limb lengthening nail is an off-label technique that may be considered for patients requiring ongoing or later lengthening of the femur, tibia or humerus. Regardless of whether the nail is used in the same lengthening episode or separate lengthening episode, surgeons should be prepared for exchange to a new implant. Re-use of a magnetically controlled intramedullary lengthening nail will reduce surgical trauma and save implant cost in limb lengthening treatment but may only be possible in half of attempted cases.

Penthrox,"Methoxyflurane has excellent analgesic properties and is approved for use in the United Kingdom and Ireland since 2015. It is currently used in emergency departments for analgesia during fracture reductions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, with theatre access severely restricted, Penthrox® had the potential to provide adequate pain relief to aid frame and wire removal in the clinic setting. Patients presenting to the limb reconstruction service elective clinic and requiring frame removal or minor procedures were included in the study. Patients with renal, cardiac or hepatic disease, a history of sensitivity to fluorinated anaesthetic agents and those on any nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs were excluded. All procedures were performed in an appropriate isolated room in the clinic. Patient demographics, procedure details, visual analogue score, Richmond Agitation Scale and patient satisfaction were recorded. A total of 39 patients were included in the study of which 17 had Ilizarov frames removed, 10 had hexapod removals, nine had heel rings removed and three had an external fixator removed. Eleven patients received additional pain relief in the form of oral analgesia. All patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the experience. One patient required a general anaesthetic for the removal of a wire that could not be removed in the clinic due to bony overgrowth. Patient satisfaction was very high (>95%), and it was possible to perform frame removals and minor procedures in the clinic environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We see potential for regular use of Penthrox® in the future for the removal of external fixation outside of the operating theatre. Penthrox as an analgesic for frame adjustments and removals is safe and has the potential for significant financial savings for the National Health Service (NHS).

The Cambridge Experience with Lower Limb Long Bone Non-union Following Fixation and the Treatment Algorithm.,"Non-unions have been traditionally classified as atrophic, oligotrophic and hypertrophic and their management was primarily dictated by that. In our Unit, we have based our treatment rationale mainly on the stability of the metalwork and the presence of symptoms rather than the radiologic appearance of the non-union or the presence of infection. The aim was to present the treatment algorithm for lower limb long bone non-union following operative fixation. All patients treated for a femoral or tibial non-union following fixation between 2014 and 2020 in our unit and with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were included. Non-union was defined as having no evidence of fracture healing in any cortices six months after the index procedure. Union was defined as bridging callus in at least three cortices visualized on at least two orthogonal radiographs. Information retrieved included demographic and fracture characteristics, presence of infection, evidence of metalwork stability and treatment. Outcome measures included union rate, time to union and complications. Data were analysed with the Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) using contingency tables and linear regression. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Seventy-seven consecutive patients were included in the study. Union was achieved in 91% of the cases, while union was noted in all the patients treated non-operatively. The mean time to union was 14.49 months (9.98). Complications were encountered in 20 of the patients and the most common were docking site non-union and metalwork breakage. Infection was the only factor that affected time to union in a statistically significant manner (p = 0.006). The results of our study suggest that in cases of long bone non-union following operative fixation using signs of metalwork instability and the presence of clinical symptoms as the main indication for surgical intervention provides a satisfactory outcome. This approach prevented operative management in a large proportion of patients. This article presents an algorithmic approach that could aid clinicians in their decision-making in long-bone non-union management. Therapeutic level III. Poutoglidou F, Krkovic M.

Magnetically Driven Intramedullary Limb Lengthening in Patients with Pre-existing Implanted Programmable Devices: A Case Series.,"The aim of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the use of magnetically controlled intramedullary nails in patient with programmable implantable devices. Magnetically driven intramedullary limb lengthening devices have revolutionised the field of limb reconstruction. Because the system is powered by strong magnets, there are warnings to avoid the use of the device in patients with implanted programmable devices, such as cardiac pacemakers. Four patients with three different types of programmable implanted devices presented to two centres for limb lengthening and limb reconstruction. Each patient had a limb length discrepancy and desired correction using an intramedullary lengthening device. After thorough counselling about the potential risks and benefits of the procedure as well as discussions with each patient's medical team, the decision to proceed with surgery was made. All four patients underwent osteoplasty with insertion of a magnetically driven intramedullary lengthening nail. Goal length was achieved with successful consolidation and subsequent nail removal in all patients. There were no malfunctions of the implantable devices during the distraction phase in any of the patients. With proper precautions, intramedullary lengthening can be performed safely and successfully using a magnetically driven nail in patients with previously implanted programmable devices. This initial experience suggests use of magnetically controlled intramedullary nails in patient with programmable implantable devices can be undertaken safely within constraints of precautions.

Gradual Correction of Valgus Deformities of the Tibia Using a Monolateral External Fixator.,"To present a review of patients subjected to gradual correction of a valgus deformity of the tibia using a monolateral external fixator. This retrospective review included patients from January 2012 to May 2022 who met the following inclusion criteria: deviation of mechanical axis of the limb due to valgus deformity of the tibia; tibial deformity in the coronal plane on radiographic examination; a documented outpatient pre-operative evaluation by an orthopaedic surgeon and age between 10 and 70 years. The following exclusion criteria were applied: the presence of another tibia deformity preventing gradual correction using the proposed assembly; skin conditions incompatible with the surgical procedure; inadequate pre- or post-operative radiological evaluation; and insufficient information in the medical records. The mean age of patients with a valgus deformity of the tibia was 30.8 ± 15.9 years. These patients had a body mass index (BMI) of 26.1 ± 5.5 kg/m2. A congenital or developmental aetiology was attributed to 58.3% of the cases. Most commonly, the deformity was found in the middle third of the tibia with a mean deformity of 14.7 ± 6.6 degrees. The total external fixator time ranged from 73 to 229 days (average 149.7 ± 36.1 days). The mean medial proximal and lateral distal tibial angles differed significantly for pre- and post-operative measurements (p ≤ 0.05). There were complications in eight cases; five cases of pin site infections, two cases of medial cortical fracture and one case of peroneal nerve neuropraxia. The proposed correction technique produces a satisfactory angular correction and with similar outcomes as described in the literature. Motta DP, Faria JLR, Couto A, et al.

Circumferential Periosteal Release to Treat Paediatric Leg Length Discrepancy: Medium Term Outcomes.,"This study aims to report the medium term outcomes of circumferential periosteal release of the distal femur and distal tibia in treating paediatric leg length discrepancy (LLD). A retrospective case series was performed on all patients undergoing circumferential periosteal release of the distal femur and/or tibia between 2006 and 2019. Data collected included demographics, surgical indications, post-operative leg lengths, and complications. Leg length discrepancy was calculated as actual values and percentages of the longest limb length. Final actual and percentage discrepancies were compared to initial discrepancies using a paired t-test. Patterns of discrepancy over time were analysed using linear mixed models. Eighteen patients (11 males) were identified, who underwent 25 procedures. The mean age at first surgery was 5.8 (range, 2-13). The commonest indication was congenital limb deficiency (7 patients). Five patients underwent repeat periosteal release, and one patient had three releases. The mean follow-up was 63 months [standard deviation (SD), 33.9]. Fifteen patients had sufficient data for statistical analysis.The mean actual discrepancy decreased from 2.07 cm (SD, 1.07) to 1.12 cm (SD, 1.62), and the mean relative discrepancy from 4.3% (SD, 2.8) to 1.5% (SD, 2.4). Significant mean reductions were seen in both actual discrepancies [0.61 cm (95% CI: 0.05-1.16; p = 0.034)], and percentage discrepancy [2.10% (95% CI: 1.0-3.1, p = <0.001]). In five patients, the operated limb overgrew the contralateral limb. Patients whose operated limb overgrew still had a reduction in LLD, with a mean residual discrepancy less than 1 cm (mean 0.7 cm, 95% CI: From -0.9 to 2.4). Circumferential periosteal release produces a significant decrease in both actual and percentage LLD. We believe this procedure is best indicated in younger patients with congenital LLD in whom the discrepancy is predicted to increase as they age. Circumferential periosteal release produces a significant decrease in LLD. This procedure can be used to manage symptoms during growth, particularly at the point where orthotic usage may become problematic, and to potentially reduce the magnitude of surgery needed at an older age.

Bone Transport with the Taylor Spatial Frame Technique: A Case Series.,"Bone transport is a beneficial reconstructive method for bone defects caused by infected non-unions or bone tumours. The Taylor Spatial Frame (TSF) is a three-dimensional corrective external fixator that can be used to achieve bone transport and correct any residual deformities easily at any time. This study reports the results of bone transport using TSF. This is a retrospective study of ten patients who underwent bone transport using the TSF. The mean age was 32.3 years; the femur was affected in one case and the lower leg in nine. Bone defects were due to infected non-unions in seven cases and bone tumours in three. The duration of external fixation, bone transport distance, distraction index (DI), alignment at the end of correction, leg length discrepancy, and complications were investigated. The average bone transport distance was 76.0 mm. The external fixation period averaged 367 days with the DI at 20.8 days/cm. Deformity at the docking site was assessed to have an average 2.6° deformity and 2.0 mm translation in the frontal view, as well as 3.3° deformity and 3.7 mm translation in the lateral view. The mean leg length discrepancy was 10.9 mm and the percentage of the mechanical axis (%MA) was 40.6%. Four patients underwent plate conversion after correction and two required additional surgery for non-union at the docking site. Bone union was achieved in all patients and there was no reaggravation of infection or tumour recurrence. The TSF allowed for the correction of deformities and translations that occurred during bone transport giving excellent results. However, as with bone transport using this or other devices, additional procedures are often needed to obtain consolidation or docking site union. Shimokawa K, Matsubara H, Hikichi T, et al.

Parakinesia Brachialis Oscitans in a Patient With a First Manifestation of Multiple Sclerosis.,"Parakinesia brachialis oscitans (PBO) is the involuntary movement of an otherwise paretic upper limb triggered by yawning. We describe the first case of PBO in a patient with a first manifestation of tumefactive multiple sclerosis (MS). A 35-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a first episode of generalized seizure. Neurologic examination revealed left-sided spastic hemiparesis, predominantly affecting his upper limb. Brain MRI showed a tumefactive right hemisphere lesion consistent with demyelination. CSF did not document unmatched oligoclonal bands. Two weeks after admission and, despite being unable to voluntarily raise his left arm, the patient noticed a repeated and reproducible involuntary raise of this limb upon yawning, consistent with PBO. In the following weeks, the phenomenon diminished both in frequency and movement amplitude alongside motor recovery. An MRI performed 2 months later showed progression of the demyelinating lesion load and confirmed a diagnosis of MS. PBO is an example of autonomic voluntary motor dissociation and reflects the interplay between loss of cortical inhibition of the cerebellum in the setting of functional spinocerebellar pathways. Clinicians should be aware of this transient phenomenon which should not be mistaken as a chronic movement disorder or focal epileptic seizures.",,trauma

Traumatic pneumocephalus as a possible early sign of acute spinal cord injury: Case report.,"Traumatic pneumocephalus (TPC) following craniofacial injuries is common, but isolated TPC secondary to pneumorrhachis (PR) is the rare result of upward gas migration from the spinal canal. In the absence of craniofacial and grossly unstable spinal fractures, the etiology of TPC in polytrauma can be elusive and an underlying diagnosis of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) can be easily missed. We report the first polytrauma case where TPC was the most reliable early sign of SCI. A 34-year-old polytrauma female with imaging findings of TPC, which was later found to be secondary to an underlying SCI. As a focused exam could not be performed at admission, the TPC was first attributed to undiagnosed craniofacial injuries. Tertiary survey revealed the patient being paraplegic and MRI workup demonstrated an acute SCI at the T3-T4 level. PR was the most likely cause of TPC in the absence of other craniofacial injuries. The patient did not have a meaningful recovery given the extensive hemispheric infarcts, spinal cord injury, and respiratory failure. Although uncommon, TPC may be an important radiographic sign suggesting the possibility of an underlying SCI in polytrauma patients. especially when focused neurologic assessment is limited at admission. Polytrauma patients with TPC and PR in the absence of coexisting craniofacial fractures require an urgent spine consultation by the ER physician, with possible early spine MRI workup. We suggest a diagnostic algorithm for the early identification of SCI in polytrauma patients presenting with TPC and propose considering 3 groups which may have different risks for SCI based on their clinical presentation and the presence of PR.",Emergency;Pneumocephalus;Pneumorrhachis;Polytrauma;Spinal cord injury;Spine,trauma
Ultra-early (≤8 hours) surgery for thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The impact of the timing of surgery on neurological recovery in thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries (tSCI) is still a subject of discussion. Accumulating evidence is supporting early decompression (<24 hours) following tSCI. However, the potential advantages of earlier decompression remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarize and analyze the current evidence on the effectiveness of ultra-early decompression surgery on clinical outcomes following tSCI. A search was conducted in the electronic databases Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science from their inception until May 2022 for human studies. Groups were stratified into ultra-early (surgery within 8 hours of injury) vs control group operated >8 hours of injury. The authors included the study data from their institutional case series of thoracolumbar spinal cord injury from 2015 to 2018. An arm-based meta-analysis was performed on all studies using the R Studio. For studies that qualified, a contrast-based meta-analysis was also performed with a standardized mean difference (SMD). Outcomes were reported as effect size, treatment effect, and effect difference, all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Of the 133 patients, 74.4% patients were male. 76 (57.1%) underwent decompression ≤8 hours, while 57 (42.9%) underwent decompression >8 hours from injury. Quantitative analysis using the SMD model showed a significant difference in mean AIS improvement in the ultra-early group (Effect size 1.15 [0.62-1.67], p<.0001). On arm-based meta-analysis, a statistically significant treatment effect was found for the ultra-early arm (1.25 [0.91-1.67]), while > 8-hour arm did not show significance (0.30 [-0.08-0.71]). There was a statistically significant effect difference between the two arms (0.96 [0.49-1.48]). This study observed a significant improvement in the mean AIS score in patients undergoing decompression within 8 hours of tSCI. Given the scant literature regarding ultra-early decompression of tSCI, this study solidifies the need to further explore the role of early interventions for tSCIs to improve patient outcomes.",Lumbar spine;Meta-analysis;Neurological recovery;Spinal cord injury;Surgical decompression;Systematic review;Thoracic spine;Thoracolumbar spine,trauma
Exploring the interplay between metabolic power and equivalent distance in training games and official matches in soccer: a machine learning approach.,"Introduction: This study aimed to explore the interplay between metabolic power (MP) and equivalent distance (ED) and their respective roles in training games (TGs) and official soccer matches. Furthermore, the secondary objective was to investigate the connection between external training load (ETL), determined by the interplay of metabolic power and equivalent distance, and internal training load (ITL) assessed through HR-based methods, serving as a measure of criterion validity. Methods: Twenty-one elite professional male soccer players participated in the study. Players were monitored during 11 months of full training and overall official matches. The study used a dataset of 4269 training games and 380 official matches split into training and test sets. In terms of machine learning methods, the study applied several techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support-Vector Machine classifiers. The dataset was divided into two subsets: a training set used for model training and a test set used for evaluation. Results: Based on metabolic power and equivalent distance, the study successfully employed four machine learning methods to accurately distinguish between the two types of soccer activities: TGs and official matches. The area under the curve (AUC) values ranged from 0.90 to 0.96, demonstrating high discriminatory power, with accuracy levels ranging from 0.89 to 0.98. Furthermore, the significant correlations observed between Edwards' training load (TL) and TL calculated from metabolic power metrics confirm the validity of these variables in assessing external training load in soccer. The correlation coefficients (r values) ranged from 0.59 to 0.87, all reaching statistical significance at p < 0.001. Discussion: These results underscore the critical importance of investigating the interaction between metabolic power and equivalent distance in soccer. While the overall intensity may appear similar between TGs and official matches, it is evident that underlying factors contributing to this intensity differ significantly. This highlights the necessity for more comprehensive analyses of the specific elements influencing physical effort during these activities. By addressing this fundamental aspect, this study contributes valuable insights to the field of sports science, aiding in the development of tailored training programs and strategies that can optimize player performance and reduce the risk of injuries in elite soccer.",equivalent distance (ED);machine learning (ML);metabolic power (MP);soccer (football);training load (TL),trauma
Varus mal-alignment and residual displacement are associated with delayed union in subtrochanteric femur fracture- A retrospective observational study.,"Subtrochanteric femoral (ST) fractures are associated with high rates of delayed and non-union. The aim of this study was to analyse the risk factors associated with delayed/non-union in ST fractures. All patients with surgical stabilisation of ST fractures during the period 2014 to 2019 were identified in an electronic patient records database in two trauma centres. Exclusion criteria were incomplete clinical/radiological data, pathological fractures and loss to follow-up. Radiographs at about 6 months post-surgery were assessed for fracture union using Radiographic Union Score for Hip (RUSH). Fracture was deemed to be un-united if RUSH score was <18. CCD (caput-collum-diaphyseal) angle of operated and uninjured hip, residual displacement at fracture site and 3-point relationship was calculated on operative or immediate post-operative images in both groups. Student's t-test was used to compare CCD angle difference between operated and uninjured sides and the residual fracture displacement between delayed union and united fractures group. Chi-square test was used for 3-point relationship. Observational analysis was performed on implant failure rates including distal screw breakage. During the study period, there were total of 278 patients. 193 with inadequate data and 22 with pathological fractures were excluded. Advanced age and female sex had significantly higher rate of delayed union (p value of 0.043 and 0.003 respectively). Delayed union group (26) had a mean RUSH score of 14.1 and united group (37) had a mean RUSH score of 26.3 (p = 0.019). The mean CCD angle difference between operated and uninjured sides was -5.77° for delayed union and -2.33° for united fractures (p = 0.03). Residual displacement at fracture site showed statistically significant difference between delayed union and united fractures on anteroposterior and lateral views (p = 0.001 each). There was no statistical difference in 3-point relationship of implant in two groups (p = 0.775). 10 revision procedures were performed for implant failures. Distal screw failure (3 cases) was not a precursor for non-union in this study. This study confirms varus alignment of hip and residual fracture displacement after fracture fixation of subtrochanteric fracture are surgeon associated significant risk factors for delayed union at 6 months. Fracture contact and alignment are key to reduce failures in these group of fractures. Among patient factors, advancing age and female sex predisposes to higher rate of delayed union.",Delayed union;Fracture displacement;Subtrochanteric femoral fracture;Varus alignment,trauma
Securing the Root: Meniscus Root Repair with Rip Stop and Cannulated Drilling.,"Meniscal root pathology has garnered increased attention over the past decade. Meniscal root tears are considered to essentially represent a meniscus-deficient state, which has led to a rise in the surgical fixation of this pathology. Meniscus root tears are classified as either radial tears within 1 cm of the root insertion, or a direct avulsion of meniscal root. These injuries are important to recognize because they contribute to impaired joint mechanics and rapid articular cartilage degeneration. Given this, there remains significant interest in identifying novel surgical techniques that may facilitate better surgical repair and enhance patient outcomes. The purpose of this technical note is to describe a surgical technique for a medial meniscus root ripstop repair with cannulated drilling. This technique is simple and reproducible, while also allowing for the augmentation of potentially poor tissue quality.",,trauma

Primary repair of complete Achilles tear augmented with amnion allograft wrap in college basketball player with a history of contralateral Achilles rupture: a case report.,"The Achilles tendon is the thickest tendon in the human body and is responsible for plantar flexion with muscle contraction. It is able to withstand tensile loads as large as ten times the body's weight or greater at times of peak stress on the tendon. Due to the repetitive and massive stress inflicted on the Achilles tendon, it is prone to injuries, especially in running and jumping athletes. Ruptures typically present after unsustainable stress placed on the tendon from rapid contraction with classic presentation of a sudden ""pop"". These injuries tend to occur in middle-aged men after atypical physical exertion with complaints of immense pain in the posterior lower leg. This case examines a 20-year-old athlete presenting to the emergency department after sustaining a left calf injury while playing basketball. The patient suffered a full-thickness tear of the Achilles tendon with retraction and subsequent anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligament deficiency. This presentation is unique as he has a past medical history of an Achilles tear in the contralateral limb. This study concluded that the bilateral Achilles tears in such a young patient were caused by anatomical blood supply watershed area to the Achilles tendon and anatomical ankle alignment abnormalities. This study provided a viable option to successfully repair complex Achilles tears via close reduction internal fixation (CRIF) with allograft matrix.",Achilles tendon;amnion allograft;case report,trauma
Beyond the gut: spectrum of magnetic surgery devices.,"Since the 1970s, magnetic force has been used to augment modern surgical techniques with the aims of minimizing surgical trauma and optimizing minimally-invasive systems. The majority of current clinical applications for magnetic surgery are largely centered around gastrointestinal uses-such as gastrointestinal or bilioenteric anastomosis creation, stricturoplasty, sphincter augmentation, and the guidance of nasoenteric feeding tubes. However, as the field of magnetic surgery continues to advance, the development and clinical implementation of magnetic devices has expanded to treat a variety of non-gastrointestinal disorders including musculoskeletal (pectus excavatum, scoliosis), respiratory (obstructive sleep apnea), cardiovascular (coronary artery stenosis, end-stage renal disease), and genitourinary (stricture, nephrolithiasis) conditions.

Glanzmann Thrombasthenia Associated with Siderotic Synovitis and Arthropathy: A Case Report.,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a bleeding disorder with a low incidence. It typically manifests as superficial bleeding episodes, which tend to be mild. Deep organ involvement is not uncommon but remains rare due to the rarity of the disease itself and the unusual association between platelet disorders and deep organ implications. A 17-year-old boy with Glanzmann thrombasthenia since infancy developed ankle pain after a minor trauma. His initial workup was negative, but he continued to experience ankle pain. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done after four weeks suggested siderotic synovitis. The patient was lost to follow-up after that and returned after two years with recurrent left ankle pain. Imaging and studies have shown evidence of chronic arthropathy. A specialized orthopedic team assessed the patient. The patient underwent intra-articular steroid injection for pain relief and was referred to continue physical therapy. In conclusion, hemarthrosis is more common in hemophilia than in platelet disorders and has potential morbidity and quality-of-life implications.",Glanzmann thrombasthenia;hemarthrosis;synovitis,trauma
Radiological Findings of the Lumbar Spine in High School and Collegiate Sumo Wrestlers.,"Sumo wrestling is a traditional sport in Japan and becoming popular worldwide. Risk factors for lower back injuries in sumo wrestlers are heavier weight and larger body mass index (BMI). The mawashi (loincloth belt) worn by sumo wrestlers has been shown to restrict motion of the lumbar spine. To study the effects of sumo wrestling on the lumbar spine of high school and freshmen collegiate wrestlers, investigating the relationship between radiological findings, wearing of the mawashi during training, and lower back symptoms. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. From 2001 to 2017, a total of 197 members of the Japanese Sumo Federation (55 high school and 142 college freshman students) underwent routine radiographic examination of their lumbar spines and answered a questionnaire regarding lumbar symptoms. Wrestlers were classified as symptomatic and asymptomatic based on responses to a custom questionnaire. We used the unpaired t test to evaluate patient demographics and the chi square test to analyze radiographic lumbar spine abnormalities between symptomatic and asymptomatic wrestlers. The wrestlers' mean height, weight, BMI, and duration in the sport were 174.0 ± 6.7 cm, 107.1 ± 22.4 kg, 35.2 ± 6.4, and 8.0 ± 3.2 years, respectively. There were 91 participants in the symptomatic group (46.2%) and 106 (53.8%) in the asymptomatic group. Ten wrestlers (5.1%) had osteophyte formations in the lumbar body; 8 of the 11 osteophytes (72.7%) appeared in the upper lumbar spine. Of the total, 48 wrestlers (24.4%) had deformities (Schmorl nodules) in the lumbar body, and 23 of 50 (46.0%) and 10 of 16 (62.5%) deformities were found in the upper lumbar spine of collegiate and high school wrestlers, respectively. Five wrestlers of the total 197 athletes (2.5%) had disc space narrowing in the lumbar body, with 3 of the 5 cases of disc space narrowing (60.0%) found in the upper lumbar spine. Spondylolysis in the lumbar body was found in 25 wrestlers (12.7%); 19 of the 91 symptomatic wrestlers (20.9%) had spondylolysis, compared with 6 of the 106 (5.7%) asymptomatic wrestlers (P = .0028). Almost one-third of sumo wrestlers had ≥1 abnormal radiological finding in the lumbar spine. There was a significant relationship between symptomatic wrestlers and spondylolysis.",lumbar spine;mawashi;radiological findings;sumo wrestling,trauma
Early Tendon Morphology as a Biomarker of Long-term Patient Outcomes After Surgical Repair of Achilles Tendon Rupture: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Patient outcome after acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) varies and is difficult to predict. Whether early variations in healing, visualized with ultrasonography, can predict long-term patient outcome is unclear. To (1) examine the associations of Achilles tendon cross-sectional area (CSA) and elongation (TE) during healing of ATR repair with patient outcomes at 12 months postoperatively and (2) investigate the predictive or diagnostic capacity of the morphological biomarkers. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. This study was based on previously collected data from 86 patients who underwent acute standardized ATR repair between 2013 and 2018 and who were included in a prior randomized trial investigating early functional mobilization (EFM). In the EFM group, loading was allowed immediately after surgery, while in the comparison group, loading was allowed first at 2 weeks postoperatively. Achilles tendon CSA and length were measured with ultrasound at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. CSA ratio and absolute difference in the length of the healthy and injured tendons were calculated. Patient-reported outcome was registered with the validated Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score and functional outcome with the heel-rise endurance test at 12 months postoperatively. The limb symmetry index (LSI) was calculated for maximum heel-rise height (HRHmax) and total concentric work. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age was used, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate predictive capacity. A larger CSA ratio at 6 weeks was associated with higher LSI HRHmax at 12 months (R2, 0.35; P < .001) and exhibited good predictive capacity (AUC, 0.82). More TE at 12 months was associated with lower LSI total concentric work at 12 months (R2, 0.21; P = .001) and exhibited acceptable predictive capacity (AUC, 0.71). Greater Achilles tendon CSA seen on ultrasound 6 weeks after surgical repair had good clinical prediction for long-term functional outcome. TE at 12 months was predictive of inferior functional outcome.

"The association between Thoroughbred racehorse training practices and musculoskeletal injuries in Victoria, Australia.","Catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries (CMI) in horses are associated with both too little and too much high-speed exercise. In order to advise trainers on training and management strategies that minimize the risk of musculoskeletal injury (MSI), a better understanding of how training practices affect MSI in racehorses is needed. Data from prospective studies relating training data and MSI are complicated by the gradual development of pathology and the effect of this on the ability of horses to train consistently prior to the identification of an injury. To circumvent this, 66 Australian Thoroughbred trainers were surveyed on their intended training practices, including rest, pre-training, and race-fit practices. Associations between intended training practices and catastrophic and non-catastrophic race day MSI outcomes in two-year-old and mature (≥three-year-old) horses were assessed using multivariable negative binomial regression models. The incidence of two-year-old race day MSI was lower for trainers who preferred shorter times (weeks) to trial, less time in fast work pre-trial (p = 0.003), shorter, more frequent rest periods (p < 0.01) and higher amounts of fast work at 15.5-16.7 m/s once race-fit (p = 0.001). The incidence of mature horse race day MSI was lower for trainers who preferred longer rest periods (p = 0.026) and a high-volume pre-trial training strategy comprising a high volume of slower speed gallop training and longer times to trial compared to fast and light training programs (p = 0.004) for their mature horses, in addition to higher amounts of fast work at 15.5-16.7 m/s for their race-fit two-year-olds (p = 0.012). Race day CMI incidence was lower for trainers who preferred lower volumes of fast gallop work for their race-fit mature horses (p < 0.05). These results suggest that two-year-old training practices could affect MSI risk later in a horse's career, and that age and stage in training (pre-trial, race-fit) are important considerations when developing training practices to minimize the risk of MSI.",Australia;Thoroughbred;injury;musculoskeletal;racehorse;racing;training,trauma
Development of the oppression-based traumatic stress inventory: a novel and intersectional approach to measuring traumatic stress.,"There is a growing body of literature demonstrating that experiences of oppression (e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism, poverty) are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Traditional trauma assessments do not assess experiences of oppression and it is therefore imperative to develop instruments that do. To assess oppression-based traumatic stress broadly, and in an intersectional manner, we have developed the oppression-based traumatic stress inventory (OBTSI). The OBTSI includes two parts. Part A comprises open-ended questions asking participants to describe experiences of oppression as well as a set of questions to determine whether Criterion A for PTSD is met. Part B assesses specific posttraumatic stress symptoms anchored to the previously described experiences of oppression and also asks participants to identify the various types of discrimination they have experienced (e.g., based on racial group, sex/gender, sexual orientation, etc.). Clients from a mental health clinic and an undergraduate sample responded to the OBTSI and other self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and traditional posttraumatic stress (N = 90). Preliminary analyses demonstrate strong internal consistency reliability for the overall symptom inventory (α = 0.97) as well as for the four symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress symptoms in the DSM-5 (α ranging from 0.86 to 0.94). In addition to providing descriptive information, we also assess the convergent validity between the OBTSI and measures of anxiety, depression, and traditional posttraumatic stress and examine the factor structure. This study provides preliminary evidence that the OBTSI is a reliable and valid method of assessing oppression-based traumatic stress symptoms.",assessment;heterosexism;homophobia;minority stress;racism;sexism;trauma,trauma
Understanding the prolonged impact of online sexual abuse occurring in childhood.,"There has been a rapid increase in prevalence rates of online sexual abuse (OSA). Existing research has highlighted the negative impact OSA can have on victims. However, there is a gap in understanding the long-term impact of OSA when it occurred in childhood. This qualitative study comprised interviews with eight female participants aged 18-28  years recruited in UK NHS Trusts, and via mental health charities, University bulletins and social media. Each participant self-reported having experienced abuse through either the production or dissemination of sexual material online. Results showed that the longer-term impact of OSA was multi-fold, including negative impact on sense of self and broader interpersonal relationships, and significant impact on the participants' mental health, including experiences of self-harm, anxiety, and low mood. Likewise, participants discussed long-term apprehension to taking images and the added fear and worry that their sexual images were distributed online. Seven participants had received mental health support but only two recounted a positive experience when receiving support for OSA. Future research using a quantitative longitudinal design is needed to further explore the prolonged impact of OSA. Clinical implications of the research highlight the need for support services to assess the impact of OSA and interventions that target OSA experiences.",adverse childhood experiences;mental health;online harms;sexual abuse;technology;trauma,trauma
Stent assisted coil embolization for a dissecting cerebral aneurysm of middle cerebral artery: A case report and the literature review.,"Dissecting aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) are very rare. We herein report a case of an unruptured dissecting aneurysm of the MCA treated by stent-assisted coil embolization. A 65-year-old man with no history of trauma presented with a headache. Time-of-flight imaging revealed a dissecting cerebral aneurysm in the right M1 segment of the MCA, and the aneurysm had increased in size within a short time. We treated the aneurysm by endovascular stenting with coils, and the patient developed no neurological deficits. Because of the potential involvement of the lenticulostriate artery (LSA) in the area of dissection, choosing the best treatment (such as direct surgery or endovascular treatment) may be challenging. Treatment efficacy depends on whether the LSA is affected and on the length of the dissection. In our case, the dissection did not involve the LSA and could therefore be treated by stent-assisted coil embolization.",Dissecting aneurysm;Middle cerebral artery;Stent-assisted coil embolization,trauma
Intraoperative embolectomy of a left illiac artery thrombus during an anterior lumbar interbody fusion.,"Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) offers direct midline access to the lumbar intervertebral discs utilizing an anterior retroperitoneal approach. Here, a 33-year-old female undergoing ALIF developed an acute intraoperative left iliac artery thrombus and underwent immediate successful embolectomy. A 33-year-old female was undergoing routine L5-S1 ALIF when an acute intraoperative left iliac vein injury occurred, requiring immediate repair by a vascular surgeon. Her left foot pulse oximeter showed a decreased reading, and her Doppler ultrasound confirmed reduced flow in the distal external iliac artery due to a thrombus. She required an immediate left iliac artery embolectomy, and flow was immediately restored. Postoperatively, she recovered well, and 3 months postoperatively, she remained neurologically intact without any further complications. Using pulse oximeters in patients undergoing ALIF surgery can aid in facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of acute artery thrombi. When such vascular injuries arise, having immediate access to experienced vascular surgeons is critical to obtain expeditious treatment and optimize patient outcomes.",Anterior lumbar interbody fusion embolectomy;Anterior lumbar interbody fusion embolus;Anterior lumbar interbody fusion vascular injury;Anterior lumbar interbody fusion vessel injury,trauma
Allogenic umbilical cord tissue for temporomandibular joint injuries.,"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is crucial for functions of daily living such as mastication and articulation. Common TMJ issues include osteoarthritis, internal derangement, and myofascial pain dysfunction. Conservative methods such as physical therapy and medications are used, with surgical options such as arthroscopy and replacement for severe cases. Emerging regenerative medicine explores non-surgical treatments using human stem cells from umbilical cord derivatives, showing potential for tissue regeneration in TMJ disorders. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, aiming to identify relevant articles published in English until August 2023. The search used specific terms to target in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies on umbilical cord (UC)-derived tissue and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for treating TMJ disorders. The search was extended to three clinical trial registries for on-going investigations related to UC tissue and MSCs for TMJ disorder management. The studies included in this article report the safety and efficacy profiles of allogenically acquired, umbilical cord-derived tissues and associated mesenchymal stem cells for temporomandibular joint ailments, future adequately powered, randomized controlled trials are warranted to conclusively justify the clinical use of this biologic therapy.",TMJ;Wharton’s jelly;mesenchymal stem cells;regenerative medicine;temporomandibular joint;umbilical cord,trauma
Predictors of mortality in patients with isolated gastrointestinal perforation.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation is common in the emergency department and has a high mortality rate. The present study aimed to identify risk factors for mortality in patients with GI perforation. The objective was to assess and prognosticate the surgical outcomes of patients, aiming to ascertain the efficacy of the procedure for individual patients. A retrospective cohort study of patients with GI perforation who underwent surgery in a public tertiary hospital in China from January 2012 to June 2022 was performed. Demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and imaging results, and outcomes were collected from electronic medical records. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality, and patients were divided into survivor and non-survivor groups based on this measure. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain independent factors associated with mortality. A total of 529 patients with GI perforation were eligible for inclusion. The in-hospital mortality rate after emergency surgery was 10.59%. The median age of the patients was 60 years (interquartile range, 44-72 years). Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that age, shock on admission, elevated serum creatinine (sCr) and white blood cell (WBC) count <3.5x109 or >20x109 cells/l were predictors of in-hospital mortality. In conclusion, advanced age, shock on admission, elevated sCr levels and significantly abnormal WBC count are associated with higher in-hospital mortality following emergency laparotomy.",emergency laparotomy;gastrointestinal perforation;mortality;risk factors,trauma
Patient Experience in Adjunct Controller-Free Hand Tracking Virtual Reality Tasks for Upper-Limb Occupational Therapy Rehabilitation.,"Benefits of immersive virtual reality rehabilitation (VRR) include increased motivation and improved transfer of skills to real-world tasks. The introduction of Oculus hand-tracking technology allowed for the development of VRR games that do not need virtual reality (VR) hand controllers. This is beneficial as participants with upper limb impairments/injuries may have difficulties with/be limited in using/manipulating VR hand controllers. In this project, a VRR game was developed and evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine patient experience when using VRR as an adjunct to upper-limb rehabilitation. N  =  20 participants receiving upper limb rehabilitation completed a series of VRR tasks by playing the ""smoothie bar"" VRR game. After the completion of the VRR tasks, the participant experience was evaluated via a study-specific questionnaire. Key findings include 95% agreement that VRR tasks were fun and engaging and 75% agreed that VR tasks will be helpful to include in their rehabilitation. Hands-tracking VRR has a high potential to be used as an adjunct intervention in upper limb rehabilitation.",hands-free;occupational therapy;rehabilitation;upper limb;virtual reality,trauma
The one-week and three-month reliability of acceleration outcomes from an insole-embedded inertial measurement unit during treadmill running.,"Inertial measurement units (IMUs) represent an exciting opportunity for researchers to broaden our understanding of running-related injuries, and for clinicians to expand their application of running gait analysis. The primary aim of our study was to investigate the 1-week (short-term) and 3-month (long-term) reliability of peak resultant, vertical, and anteroposterior accelerations derived from insole-embedded IMUs. The secondary aim was to assess the reliability of peak acceleration variability and left-right limb symmetry in all directions over the short and long term. A sample of healthy adult rearfoot runners (n = 23; age 41.7 ± 11.2 years) ran at a variety of speeds (2.5 m/s, 3.0 m/s, and 3.5 m/s) on a treadmill in standardised footwear with insole-embedded IMUs in each shoe. Peak accelerations exhibited good to excellent short-term reliability and moderate to excellent long-term reliability in all directions. Peak acceleration variability showed poor to good short- and long-term reliability, whereas the symmetry of peak accelerations demonstrated moderate to excellent and moderate to good short- and long-term reliability, respectively. Our results demonstrate how insole-embedded IMUs represent a viable option for clinicians to measure peak accelerations within the clinic.",Variability;accelerometer;biomechanics;symmetry,trauma
Factors Associated with Non-Fatal Strangulation Victimization in Intimate Relationships: A Meta-Analysis.,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health crisis across the globe, and one particular act of IPV, non-fatal strangulation, warrants serious attention. Non-fatal strangulation is a risk factor for intimate partner homicide (IPH) and can create long-term negative mental and physical health consequences. In this meta-analysis, we sought to examine factors associated with non-fatal strangulation victimization among women to help inform education and assessment efforts. Using database searches and Boolean search terms, a total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 16 factors that were found in at least two unique studies were examined. The strongest associated factors included physical IPV victimization, physical injury, IPH, and sexual IPV victimization. Other significant associated factors included lower education, anxiety symptoms, perceived risk of harm, post-traumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, stalking victimization, and identifying as a Black woman. Experiencing childhood trauma, the length of the relationship, age, substance use, and identifying as Hispanic were not significantly related to strangulation victimization by an intimate partner.

"Childhood cumulative trauma, social support and stress as predictors of illness outcomes and quality of life in bipolar disorder.","Trauma, social support and stress have been identified as factors which may be associated with the bipolar disorder illness course. However, these are yet to be examined in prospective studies as predictors of illness outcomes and overall quality of life in bipolar disorder. One hundred and fourteen participants (N = 97; 85.1% female) living with bipolar disorder I (41.2%) or II (58.8%) completed a semi-structured interview and a range of self-report measures assessing trauma history, social support, perceived stress, depression, anxiety, mania, suicidality, number of mood episodes and quality of life, at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Childhood cumulative trauma, social support and perceived stress accounted for a substantial and significant portion of the variance in quality of life (62%; 23.6%), anxiety severity (34.6%; 24.5%) and depression severity (49.6%; 26.7%), at both baseline and 6-month follow-up. Perceived stress made significant unique contributions to the prediction of all outcomes, and social support made significant unique contributions to depression and quality of life in bipolar disorder. Stress and social support play an important role in bipolar disorder and in quality of life for people living with this condition. Given that stress and social support are modifiable risk factors, this provides a promising direction for future intervention-based research.",Trauma;bipolar disorder;social support;stress,trauma

Robotic Brace Based Multi-Dimensional Assessment for Trunk Ability: A Preliminary Study in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury.,"Evaluating trunk control ability is significant in guiding patients towards proper functional training. Most existing devices have only a singular assessment function, resulting in prolonged and asynchronous assessments. Devices with multi-dimensional assessment capabilities may address these limitations. This study utilizes a robotic brace, RoboBDsys-II, to assess the trunk ability of individuals with spinal disorders and to validate its effectiveness. The device can simultaneously collect kinematic, kinetic, and center of pressure data, reducing the assessment time and enabling the simultaneous assessment. The force platform is designed to measure the center of pressure and the force control of the parallel module is developed for the coronal movement assessment. Four patients with spinal cord injury participated in the study to assess their trunk range of motion and muscle strength. Results demonstrate that the trunk range of motion determines the center of pressure metrics in lateral bending experiments. Furthermore, RoboBDsys-II exhibits excellent test-retest reliability in lateral bending experiments and can reveal the muscle strength differences in different directions. The system has potential advantage in the trunk ability assessment.",D006801:Humans;D015203:Reproducibility of Results;D065287:Robotic Surgical Procedures;D009068:Movement;D001915:Braces;D013119:Spinal Cord Injuries,trauma
Does a Soft Actuated Back Exosuit Influence Multimodal Physiological Measurements and User Perception During an Industry Inspired Task?,"Back support soft exosuits are promising solutions to reduce risk of musculoskeletal injuries at workplaces resulting from physically demanding and repetitive lifting tasks. Design of novel active exosuits address the impact on the muscle activity and metabolic costs but do not consider other critical aspects such as comfort and user perception during the intended tasks. Thus, in this study, we describe a novel soft active exosuit in line with its impact on physiological and subjective measures during lifting. We tested four healthy participants who performed repetitive lifting tasks with and without this exosuit. The exosuit provided assistance proportional to the lumbar flexion angle measured using an inertial measurement unit. We measured the participant's multimodal physiological measures including surface electromyography, metabolic cost, heart rate, and skin temperature. We also measured subjective scores on user exertion, task load, and device acceptability. All participants perceived a reduction in task load when using the exosuit. Three participants showed reduction of muscle activity for the erector spinae muscles. The metabolic costs and heart rate reserve reduced for two participants, with similar trends for skin temperature. For future development of workplace exosuits, we recommend incorporating assessments of both physiological and subjective measures, considering the user-dependent response to the exosuit.","D006801:Humans;D000067190:Exoskeleton Device;D004576:Electromyography;D008161:Lumbosacral Region;D016059:Range of Motion, Articular;D010465:Perception",trauma
A Wearable Device for Hand Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Through Augmented Sensory Feedback.,"The loss of sensitivity of the upper limb due to central or peripheral neurological injuries severely limits the ability to manipulate objects, hindering personal independence. Non-invasive augmented sensory feedback techniques are used to promote neural plasticity hence to restore the grasping function. We devised a wearable device for hand sensorimotor rehabilitation capable of reliably detect transient tactile events based on custom piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensors and deliver discrete bursts of vibrations upon these events. We integrated the sensors into a fabric glove and tested the device in a pilot bench test exploring its ability to detect object contact and release as well as object slippage. Due to their broad bandwidth, the sensors proved to be suitable for both the applications: they responded with clear peaks when touching or releasing the object and increased the high-frequency content of the signal during slippage.","D006801:Humans;D056228:Feedback, Sensory;D006225:Hand;D034941:Upper Extremity;D014110:Touch;D000076251:Wearable Electronic Devices",trauma
Learning Activities of Daily Living from Unobtrusive Multimodal Wearables: Towards Monitoring Outpatient Rehabilitation.,"Monitoring activities of daily living (ADLs) for wheelchair users, particularly spinal cord injury individuals is important for understanding the rehabilitation progress, customizing treatment plans, and observing the onset of secondary health conditions. This work proposes an innovative sensory system for measuring and classifying ADLs relevant to secondary health conditions. We systematically evaluated multiple wearable sensors such as pressure distribution mats on the wheelchair seat, accelerometer data from the ear and wrists, and IMU data from the wheelchair wheels to achieve the best unobtrusive combination of sensors that successfully distinguished ADLs. Our work resulted in an XGBoost classifier with a 20-second window size and extracted features in statistical, time, frequency, and wavelet domains, with an average class-wise F1 score of 82% (with only 3 out of 12 classes being mislabeled). Our study results demonstrate that the newly investigated modality of the bottom pressure mat emerges as the most relevant information source for recognizing ADLs, while heart and respiratory rates did not provide added value for the selected set of ADLs. The proposed sensory system and methodology proved high quality in most classes and easily extendable for long-term monitoring in outpatient rehabilitation, with the need for an extended database of activities.",D006801:Humans;D000203:Activities of Daily Living;D010045:Outpatients;D013119:Spinal Cord Injuries;D000076251:Wearable Electronic Devices,trauma
A Novel Tilted-Plane Ergometer System for Subject-Specific Rehabilitation.,"Immobilization due to various reasons can lead to disuse muscle atrophy. If prolonged, the circumstance is exacerbated and may lead to joint contracture, dysfunction, and long-term sequela. Thus, a balanced exercise regimen is crucial. While able-bodied individuals can perform a variety of exercises, bedridden patients typically resort to exercising primarily with bicycle ergometers. However, since the pedaling trajectory with ergometers is confined to the sagittal plane, muscles responsible for medial-lateral movement and balance are not effectively trained. Furthermore, the direction of joint reaction forces, which is crucial for specific patients with ligament injuries, recurrent dislocations, and medial osteoarthritis, is not well facilitated. Thus, it would be beneficial for patients without full body weight support ability to train ab-/ad-ductor muscles by altering the direction of extrinsic load via ergometers. In this study, we present a novel Tilted-Plane Ergometer and proof-of-concept experiment with one healthy subject. The results suggest that subtle changes in ergometer configurations lead to different movements, joint alignments, and muscle recruitment patterns.",D006801:Humans;D009132:Muscles;D005080:Exercise Test;D015444:Exercise;D009068:Movement,trauma
A Tailorable Robotic Hand Orthosis to Support Children with Neurological Hand Impairments: a Case Study in a Child's Home.,"Neurological disorders such as traumatic brain injuries (TBI) can lead to hand impairments in children, negatively impacting their quality of life. Fully wearable robotic hand orthoses (RHO) have been proposed to actively support children and promote the use of the impaired limb in daily life. Here we report a case study on the feasibility of using the pediatric RHO PEXO for assistance at home in a 13- year-old child with hand impairment after TBI. The size and functionalities of the RHO were first fully tailored to the child's needs. We trained the child and their parent on independently using the RHO before taking it home for a period of two weeks. The use of the RHO improved hand ability. Additionally, the tailoring and training benefited the unimanual capacity (Box and Block Test score +2 after tailoring) and bimanual performance (Assisting Hand Assessment score +4) of the child with PEXO. Further, it increased device acceptance by the child and the parent. The child used PEXO at home for 76 minutes distributed over three days during eating and drinking tasks. Personal and environmental factors caused the moderate use. No adverse events or safety-related issues occurred. This study highlights the value of tailoring an assistive RHO and, for the first time, demonstrates the feasibility of home use of a pediatric RHO by children with neurological hand impairments.",D002648:Child;D006801:Humans;D000293:Adolescent;D011788:Quality of Life;D065287:Robotic Surgical Procedures;D006225:Hand;D012371:Robotics;D009989:Orthotic Devices,trauma
Predictive Control of Peak Achilles Tendon Force in a Simulated System of the Human Ankle Joint with a Parallel Artificial Actuator During Hopping.,"Latest advances in wearable exoskeletons for the human lower extremity predominantly focus on minimising metabolic cost of walking. However, there currently is no robotic exoskeleton that gains control on the mechanics of biological tissues such as biological muscles or series-elastic tendons. Achieving robotic control of biological tissue mechanics would enable prevention of musculoskeletal injuries or the personalization of rehabilitation treatments following injury with levels of precisions not attained before. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that uses nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for the closed-loop control of peak tendon force in a simulated system of the human ankle joint with parallel exoskeletal actuation. We propose a computationally efficient NMPC's inner model consisting of explicit, closed-form equations of muscle-tendon dynamics along with those of the ankle joint with parallel actuation. The proposed formulation is tested and verified on movement data collected during dynamic ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion rotations executed on a dynamometer as well as during walking and running on a treadmill. The framework designed using the NMPC controller showed a promising performance in keeping the Achilles tendon force under a predefined threshold. Results indicated that our proposed model was generalizable to different muscles and gaits and suitable for real-time applications due to its low computational time.","D006801:Humans;D000843:Ankle Joint;D000125:Achilles Tendon;D018482:Muscle, Skeletal;D001696:Biomechanical Phenomena;D016138:Walking",trauma
Robot-Inspired Human Impedance Control Through Functional Electrical Stimulation.,"Functional Electrical Stimulation is an effective tool to foster rehabilitation of neurological patients suffering from impaired motor functions. It can also serve as an assistive device to compensate for compromised motor functions in the chronic phase occurring after a disease or trauma. In all cases, the dominant paradigm in FES applications is that of aiding specialized, task-specific movements, such as reaching or grasping. Usually this is achieved by targeting specific muscle groups which are associated to the targeted motion by experts. A general purpose, FES-based control theory capable of enabling neurological patients to achieve a wide range of positional goals in their peri-personal space is still missing. In this paper, we present an early analysis of the performance achievable through a muscular impedance control loop employing FES to actuate force and movement. The control is evaluated in a test where the user's upper limb is moved by means of an exonerve to a series of target positions on a plane without providing visual feedback nor requiring volitional effort. The results allow to characterize the performance of such a setup over time and to assess how well can it generalize over different target positions in the user's peri-personal space. The current study population also allows to evaluate the effects of user's experience with FES systems on the overall performance during the test. The results indicate that the proposed control loop can generalize well over different arm poses.",D006801:Humans;D017097:Electric Impedance;D034941:Upper Extremity;D004558:Electric Stimulation;D004599:Electric Stimulation Therapy;D009068:Movement,trauma
Risk Factors for Reintubation After Anterior Cervical Spine Surgery: Comparative Study of Patients With Cervical Spine Trauma and Patients With Cervical Degenerative Disease.,"Single-center retrospective study. The aim was to compare the postoperative outcomes of anterior cervical spine surgery (ACSS) in patients with and without cervical spine trauma. Few papers have addressed airway obstruction after anterior ACSS for patients with cervical spine trauma. This study aimed to compare airway obstruction after ACSS between patients with cervical degenerative disorders and cervical spine injuries and identify the risk factors for unplanned postoperative reintubation. Seventy-seven patients who underwent ACSS were enrolled in this retrospective study. There were 52 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 60.3±15.5 years old. The causes of surgery were as follows: 24 cervical spine fractures or dislocations, 12 spinal cord injuries without bony fracture, 19 disc herniations, and 22 myelopathies. The patients' characteristics, operative data, and risk factors for unplanned reintubation within 5 days postoperatively were analyzed using medical records. Postoperative reintubation was performed in 3 patients (3.9%), all of whom suffered trauma. We further examined risk factors for reintubation in patients in the trauma group. There was no significant difference between the reintubation (R) and nonreintubation (non-R) groups in age, sex, body mass index, amount of blood loss and operation time, preoperative paralysis severity, and the number of fused segments. Patients in group R had significantly higher rates of severe anterior element injury (100% vs. 27.3%, P=0.0011). Airway obstruction due to laryngopharyngeal edema and swelling was confirmed by laryngoscopy and computed tomography images. Unplanned reintubation after ACSS occurred at a higher rate in trauma patients than in patients with degenerative disorders. Our results suggested that the severe damage to the anterior element of the cervical spine was associated with postoperative reintubation. Level IV.",,trauma
Bladder Repair with Irrigation and Debridement and Open Reduction Internal Fixation of the Anterior Pelvic Ring is Safe and Decreases Risk of Infection in Pelvic Ring Injuries with Extraperitoneal Bladder Ruptures.,"To determine the incidence of infection in nonoperative versus operative management of extraperitoneal bladder ruptures in patients with pelvic ring injuries. Two level 1 trauma centers. A retrospective cohort study of two prospectively collected trauma registries.Patients/Participants: Of 1127 patients with operative pelvic ring injuries, 68 (6%) had extraperitoneal bladder ruptures. Primary outcome was the incidence and associated risk factors of deep pelvic infection requiring return to OR for surgical debridement. Secondary outcomes included quality of reduction, other complications, and radiographic union. Of the 68 patients with extraperitoneal bladder ruptures in the setting of an operative pelvic ring injury, 55 had bladder repair and 13 did not. Of those 13 without repair, none had ORIF of the anterior pelvic ring. Patients without bladder repair had an increased odds of infection 17-fold compared to patients who did have a repair performed (OR 16.9, 95% CI 1.75 - 164, P = 0.01). Other associated factors for deep pelvic infection included use of suprapubic catheter (P < 0.02) and a closed reduction of the anterior ring (P < 0.01). Patients undergoing anterior ring ORIF and bladder repair had improved reductions and no increased infection risk. Operative repair of extraperitoneal bladder ruptures decreases risk of infection in patients with pelvic ring injuries. Additionally, ORIF of the anterior pelvic ring does not increase risk of infection and results in better reductions compared to closed reduction. Treatment algorithms for these combined injuries should consider recommending early bladder repair and anterior pelvic ORIF. Therapeutic Level III.

Implementation of a Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block Program in Geriatric Hip Fractures: The Experience at a Level I Academic Trauma Center.,"Determine adherence to a newly implemented protocol of fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) in geriatric hip fractures.METHODS. Retrospective review. Level I trauma center. Patients with a hip fracture treated with cephallomedullary nailing or hemiarthroplasty (CPT Codes 27245 or 27236).Outcome Measures and Comparisons: Adherence to a protocol for FICB, time intervals between emergency department arrival, FICB, and surgery stratified by time of admission. 380 patients were studied (average age 78, 70% female). 53.2% of patients received a FICB, which was less than a pre-defined acceptable adherence rate of 75% (p<0.001). 5.0% received a FICB within 4 hours and 17.3% within 6 hours from admission. Admission during daylight hours (7am-7pm) when compared to evening hours (7pm-7am) was associated with improved timeliness ([8.3% vs 0% within 4 hours, p<0.001], [27.5% vs 2.4% within 6 hours, p<0.001]). Improved adherence to the protocol was observed over time (OR: 1.0013, 95% CI: 1.0001, 1.0025, p=0.0388). FICB implementation was poor but gradually improved over time. Few patients received a FICB promptly, especially during night hours. Overall, this study demonstrates that implementation of a FICB program at a level I academic trauma center can be difficult however, many hurdles can be overcome with institutional support and dedication of resources such as staff, space and additional training.",,trauma
Pilot randomized controlled trial of restricted versus liberal crystalloid fluid management in pediatric post-operative and trauma patients.,"Intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is essential in the treatment of critically ill pediatric surgery and trauma patients. Recent studies have suggested that aggressive fluids may be detrimental to patients. Prospective studies are needed to compare liberal to restricted fluid management in these patients. The primary objective of this pilot trial is to test study feasibility-recruitment and adherence to the study treatment algorithm. We conducted a two-part pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing liberal to restricted crystalloid fluid management in 50 pediatric post-operative (1-18 years) and trauma (1-15 years) patients admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Patients were randomized to a high (liberal) volume or low (restricted) volume algorithm using unblinded, blocked randomization. A revised treatment algorithm was used after the 29th patient for the second part of the RCT. The goal of the trial was to determine the feasibility of conducting an RCT at a single site for recruitment and retention. We also collected data on the safety of study interventions and clinical outcomes, including pulmonary, infectious, renal, post-operative, and length of stay outcomes. Fifty patients were randomized to either liberal (n = 26) or restricted (n = 24) fluid management strategy. After data was obtained on 29 patients, a first study analysis was performed. The volume of fluid administered and triggers for intervention were adapted to optimize the treatment effect and clarity of outcomes. Updated and refined fluid management algorithms were created. These were used for the second part of the RCT on patients 30-50. During this second study period, 54% (21/39, 95% CI 37-70%) of patients approached were enrolled in the study. Of the patients enrolled, 71% (15/21, 95% CI 48-89%) completed the study. This met our a priori recruitment and retention criteria for success. A data safety monitoring committee concluded that no adverse events were related to study interventions. Although the study was not powered to detect differences in outcomes, after the algorithm was revised, we observed a non-significant trend towards improved pulmonary outcomes in patients on the restricted arm, including decreased need for and time on oxygen support and decreased need for mechanical ventilation. We demonstrated the feasibility and safety of conducting a single-site RCT comparing liberal to restricted crystalloid fluid management in critically ill pediatric post-operative and trauma patients. We observed trends in improved pulmonary outcomes in patients undergoing restricted fluid management. A definitive multicenter RCT comparing fluid management strategies in these patients is warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04201704 .

A review on factors related to patient comfort experience in hospitals.,"The creation of a welcoming hospital atmosphere is necessary to improve patient wellbeing and encourage healing. The goal of this study was to examine the variables affecting hospitalised patients' comfort. The study procedure included a thorough search of the Web of Science and Scopus databases, as well as the use of software analytic tools to graphically map enormous literature data, providing a deeper understanding of the linkages within the literature and its changing patterns. Insights from a range of disciplines, including engineering, psychology, immunology, microbiology, and environmental science, were included into our study using content analysis and clustering approaches. The physical environment and the social environment are two crucial factors that are related to patient comfort. The study stress the need of giving patient comfort a top priority as they heal, especially by tackling indoor air pollution. Our research also emphasises how important hospital care and food guidelines are for improving patient comfort. Prioritising patients who need specialised care and attention, especially those who have suffered trauma, should be the focus of future study. Future research in important fields including trauma, communication, hospital architecture, and nursing will be built on the findings of this study. To enhance research in these crucial areas, worldwide collaboration between experts from other nations is also advised. Although many studies stress the significance of patient comfort, few have drawn conclusions from a variety of disciplines, including medicine, engineering, immunology, microbiology, and environmental science, the most crucial issue of thoroughly researching the improvement of patient comfort has not been addressed. Healthcare workers, engineers, and other professions will benefit greatly from this study's investigation of the connection between hospital indoor environments and patient comfort.","D006801:Humans;D000070659:Patient Comfort;D004777:Environment;D006282:Health Personnel;D006761:Hospitals;D016902:Air Pollution, Indoor",trauma
Efferocytosis is restricted by axon guidance molecule EphA4 via ERK/Stat6/MERTK signaling following brain injury.,"Efferocytosis is a process that removes apoptotic cells and cellular debris. Clearance of these cells alleviates neuroinflammation, prevents the release of inflammatory molecules, and promotes the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines to help maintain tissue homeostasis. The underlying mechanisms by which this occurs in the brain after injury remain ill-defined. We used GFP bone marrow chimeric knockout (KO) mice to demonstrate that the axon guidance molecule EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase is involved in suppressing MERTK in the brain to restrict efferocytosis of resident microglia and peripheral-derived monocyte/macrophages. Single-cell RNAseq identified MERTK expression, the primary receptor involved in efferocytosis, on monocytes, microglia, and a subset of astrocytes in the damaged cortex following brain injury. Loss of EphA4 on infiltrating GFP-expressing immune cells improved functional outcome concomitant with enhanced efferocytosis and overall protein expression of p-MERTK, p-ERK, and p-Stat6. The percentage of GFP+ monocyte/macrophages and resident microglia engulfing NeuN+ or TUNEL+ cells was significantly higher in KO chimeric mice. Importantly, mRNA expression of Mertk and its cognate ligand Gas6 was significantly elevated in these mice compared to the wild-type. Analysis of cell-specific expression showed that p-ERK and p-Stat6 co-localized with MERTK-expressing GFP + cells in the peri-lesional area of the cortex following brain injury. Using an in vitro efferocytosis assay, co-culturing pHrodo-labeled apoptotic Jurkat cells and bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages, we demonstrate that efferocytosis efficiency and mRNA expression of Mertk and Gas6 was enhanced in the absence of EphA4. Selective inhibitors of ERK and Stat6 attenuated this effect, confirming that EphA4 suppresses monocyte/macrophage efferocytosis via inhibition of the ERK/Stat6 pathway. Our findings implicate the ERK/Stat6/MERTK axis as a novel regulator of apoptotic debris clearance in brain injury that is restricted by peripheral myeloid-derived EphA4 to prevent the resolution of inflammation.","D051379:Mice;D000818:Animals;D000076202:c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase;D000071437:Axon Guidance;D017209:Apoptosis;D010587:Phagocytosis;D018345:Mice, Knockout;D001930:Brain Injuries;D012333:RNA, Messenger;D050800:STAT6 Transcription Factor",trauma
β-adrenergic signaling triggers enteric glial reactivity and acute enteric gliosis during surgery.,"Enteric glia contribute to the pathophysiology of various intestinal immune-driven diseases, such as postoperative ileus (POI), a motility disorder and common complication after abdominal surgery. Enteric gliosis of the intestinal muscularis externa (ME) has been identified as part of POI development. However, the glia-restricted responses and activation mechanisms are poorly understood. The sympathetic nervous system becomes rapidly activated by abdominal surgery. It modulates intestinal immunity, innervates all intestinal layers, and directly interfaces with enteric glia. We hypothesized that sympathetic innervation controls enteric glia reactivity in response to surgical trauma. Sox10iCreERT2/Rpl22HA/+ mice were subjected to a mouse model of laparotomy or intestinal manipulation to induce POI. Histological, protein, and transcriptomic analyses were performed to analyze glia-specific responses. Interactions between the sympathetic nervous system and enteric glia were studied in mice chemically depleted of TH+ sympathetic neurons and glial-restricted Sox10iCreERT2/JellyOPfl/+/Rpl22HA/+ mice, allowing optogenetic stimulation of β-adrenergic downstream signaling and glial-specific transcriptome analyses. A laparotomy model was used to study the effect of sympathetic signaling on enteric glia in the absence of intestinal manipulation. Mechanistic studies included adrenergic receptor expression profiling in vivo and in vitro and adrenergic agonism treatments of primary enteric glial cell cultures to elucidate the role of sympathetic signaling in acute enteric gliosis and POI. With ~ 4000 differentially expressed genes, the most substantial enteric glia response occurs early after intestinal manipulation. During POI, enteric glia switch into a reactive state and continuously shape their microenvironment by releasing inflammatory and migratory factors. Sympathetic denervation reduced the inflammatory response of enteric glia in the early postoperative phase. Optogenetic and pharmacological stimulation of β-adrenergic downstream signaling triggered enteric glial reactivity. Finally, distinct adrenergic agonists revealed β-1/2 adrenoceptors as the molecular targets of sympathetic-driven enteric glial reactivity. Enteric glia act as early responders during post-traumatic intestinal injury and inflammation. Intact sympathetic innervation and active β-adrenergic receptor signaling in enteric glia is a trigger of the immediate glial postoperative inflammatory response. With immune-activating cues originating from the sympathetic nervous system as early as the initial surgical incision, adrenergic signaling in enteric glia presents a promising target for preventing POI development.",D000818:Animals;D051379:Mice;D005911:Gliosis;D018663:Adrenergic Agents;D009457:Neuroglia;D015398:Signal Transduction;D013564:Sympathetic Nervous System;D017615:Enteric Nervous System,trauma
A comprehensive review on immune checkpoint inhibitors induced cardiotoxicity characteristics and associated factors.,"Newly approved cancer drugs called ICIs have shown remarkable success in improving patient survival rates, but they also have the potential for inflammatory and immune-related side effects, including those affecting the cardiovascular system. Research has been conducted to understand the development of these toxicities and identify risk factors. This review focuses on the characteristics of ICI-induced cardiotoxicity and discusses the reported risk factors. It is important for cardio-oncologists to understand the basic concepts of these drugs to better understand how cardiotoxicities occur. It might be hard to find reports, where all patients treated with ICIs had developed cardiac toxicity, because there could be other existing and variable factors that influence the likelihood or risk of developing cardiotoxicity during treatment. Various clinical parameters have been explored as potential risk factors, and further investigation is needed through large-scale studies.",D006801:Humans;D000082082:Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors;D066126:Cardiotoxicity;D006321:Heart;D012307:Risk Factors,trauma
Effect of knee osteoarthritis on the postoperative outcome of proximal femoral nail anti-rotation in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly: a retrospective analysis.,"The proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) is a commonly used internal fixation system for intertrochanteric fractures (IFs) in older adults. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a degenerative lower extremity disease that occurs most frequently in the elderly. Some patients have already had KOA before the IFs. However, whether KOA impacts the postoperative outcome of IFs has not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the effect of KOA on the fracture side on the outcome after PFNA for IFs in the elderly. Between January 2016 and November 2021, 297 elderly patients treated with PFNA for IFs were enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups according to the American Rheumatism Association KOA clinical and radiographic criteria: the control group and the KOA group. Intraoperative bleeding, operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative time out of bed, fracture healing time, postoperative complications, postoperative Harris hip function score, and Barthel ability to daily living Score were compared between the two groups. Follow-up was routinely scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Based on the exclusion criteria, 254 patients who met the requirements were left to be included in this study, including the control group (n = 133) and the KOA group (n = 121). Patients were followed up for a mean of 17.5 months (12-24 months). There was no significant difference between the two groups in preoperative demographic data, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, and length of stay in the hospital. The control group was statistically significant compared to the KOA group in terms of postoperative time out of bed (17.8 ± 4.0 days vs. 19.1 ± 5.8 days), fracture healing time (13.7 ± 2.2 weeks vs. 14.6 ± 3.7 weeks), and postoperative complications (12.8 vs. 23.1%). The Harris hip function score and Barthel ability to daily living score were higher in the control group than in the KOA group at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively (the control group: 63.8 ± 10.9, 71.8 ± 10.3, 81.5 ± 8.7, and 91.6 ± 6.3 vs. The KOA group 61.0 ± 10.4, 68.6 ± 9.1, 79.0 ± 9.2, and 88.5 ± 5.9). In elderly patients with IFs combined with KOA of the fracture side treated with PFNA internal fixation, KOA increases the incidence of postoperative complications of the fracture, prolongs postoperative time out of bed and fracture healing, and reduces postoperative hip function and ability to daily living. Therefore, treating KOA on the fractured side needs to be considered when treating IFs in the elderly.","D006801:Humans;D000368:Aged;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D016896:Treatment Outcome;D005594:Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary;D020370:Osteoarthritis, Knee;D001858:Bone Nails;D006620:Hip Fractures;D011183:Postoperative Complications;D005264:Femoral Fractures",trauma
Factor structure of the Oxford Shoulder Score: secondary analyses of the UK FROST and PROFHER trial populations.,"Frozen shoulder and proximal humeral fracture can cause pain, stiffness and loss of function. The impact of these symptoms on patients can be measured using the comprehensively validated, 12-item Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS). Evidence suggests that pain and function may have a differential impact on patients' experience of shoulder conditions, and this may be important for clinical management. We therefore explored the factor structure of the OSS within the UK FROST and PROFHER trial populations. We performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), on baseline UK FROST data from 490 of the 503 trial participants. Data at 6 months post-randomisation were used for 228 of the 250 participants for the PROFHER trial. UK FROST factor extraction results, using Velicer's Minimum Average Partial and Horn's Parallel Analysis tests, suggested a unifactorial solution, but two factors were weakly indicated by the less reliable 'Kaiser's eigenvalue > 1' and scree tests. We explored this further using EFA. Eight items (2 to 7, 9 and 10) loaded onto a 'Function' factor, three on a 'Pain' factor (1, 8 and 12) and item 11 cross-loaded. However, one- and two-factor models were rejected in CFA. Factor extraction of PROFHER data at 6 months demonstrated a single first-order factor solution, which was also subsequently rejected in CFA. Insufficient evidence was found, within the constraints of the data available, to support the use of 'Pain' and 'Function' sub-scales of the OSS in either patient population.",D006801:Humans;D016896:Treatment Outcome;D012782:Shoulder;D005592:Fracture Fixation;D012784:Shoulder Fractures;D010146:Pain;D006113:United Kingdom,trauma
Effect of non-human hosts on the human biting rate of primary and secondary malaria vectors in Tanzania.,"Malaria vectors vary in feeding preference depending on their innate behaviour, host availability and abundance. Host preference and human biting rate in malaria vectors are key factors in establishing zooprophylaxis and zoopotentiation. This study aimed at assessing the impact of non-human hosts in close proximity to humans on the human biting rate of primary and secondary malaria vectors, with varying host preferences. The effect of the presence of non-human hosts in close proximity to the human host on the mean catches per person per night, as a proxy for mosquito biting rate, was measured using mosquito-electrocuting traps (METs), in Sagamaganga, Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. Two experiments were designed: (1) a human versus a calf, each enclosed in a MET, and (2) a human surrounded by three calves versus a human alone, with each human volunteer enclosed individually in a MET spaced 10 m apart. Each experiment was conducted on alternate days and lasted for 36 nights per experiment. During each experiment, the positions of hosts were exchanged daily (except the human in experiment 2). All anopheline mosquitoes caught were assayed for Plasmodium sporozoites using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A total of 20,574 mosquitoes were captured and identified during the study, of which 3608 were anophelines (84.4% primary and 15.6% secondary malaria vectors) and 17,146 were culicines. In experiment 1, the primary malaria vector, Anopheles arabiensis, along with Culex spp. demonstrated a preference for cattle, while the primary vectors, Anopheles funestus, preferred humans. In experiment 2, both primary vectors, An. arabiensis and An. funestus, as well as the secondary vector Anopheles rivolurum, demonstrated behaviours amenable to zooprophylaxis, whereas Culex spp. increased their attraction to humans in the presence of nearby cattle. All anopheline mosquitoes tested negative for sporozoites. The findings of this study provide support for the zooprophylaxis model for malaria vectors present in the Kilombero Valley, and for the zoopotentiation model, as it pertains to the Culex spp. in the region. However, the factors regulating zooprophylaxis and zoopotentiation are complex, with different species-dependent mechanisms regulating these behaviours, that need to be considered when designing integrated vector management programmes.",D006801:Humans;D000818:Animals;D002417:Cattle;D000852:Anopheles;D008288:Malaria;D000072138:Mosquito Vectors;D013636:Tanzania;D005247:Feeding Behavior;D007299:Insect Bites and Stings;D003465:Culex;D034101:Sporozoites,trauma
Upper extremity asymmetry due to nerve injuries or central neurologic conditions: a scoping review.,"Peripheral nerve injuries and central neurologic conditions can result in extensive disabilities. In cases with unilateral impairment, assessing the asymmetry between the upper extremity has been used to assess outcomes of treatment and severity of injury. A wide variety of validated and novel tests and sensors have been utilized to determine the upper extremity asymmetry. The purpose of this article is to review the literature and define the current state of the art for describing upper extremity asymmetry in patients with peripheral nerve injuries or central neurologic conditions. An electronic literature search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, OVID was performed for publications between 2000 to 2022. Eligibility criteria were subjects with neurological conditions/injuries who were analyzed for dissimilarities in use between the upper extremities. Data related to study population, target condition/injury, types of tests performed, sensors used, real-world data collection, outcome measures of interest, and results of the study were extracted. Sackett's Level of Evidence was used to judge the quality of the articles. Of the 7281 unique articles, 112 articles met the inclusion criteria for the review. Eight target conditions/injuries were identified (Brachial Plexus Injury, Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Peripheral Nerve Injury, Spinal Cord Injury, Schizophrenia, and stroke). The tests performed were classified into thirteen categories based on the nature of the test and data collected. The general results related to upper extremity asymmetry were listed for all the reviewed articles. Stroke was the most studied condition, followed by cerebral palsy, with kinematics and strength measurement tests being the most frequently used tests. Studies with a level of evidence level II and III increased between 2000 and 2021. The use of real-world evidence-based data, and objective data collection tests also increased in the same period. Adequately powered randomized controlled trials should be used to study upper extremity asymmetry. Neurological conditions other than stroke should be studied further. Upper extremity asymmetry should be measured using objective outcome measures like motion tracking and activity monitoring in the patient's daily living environment.",D006801:Humans;D059348:Peripheral Nerve Injuries;D002547:Cerebral Palsy;D034941:Upper Extremity;D013119:Spinal Cord Injuries;D020521:Stroke,trauma
Effect of SEC III protocol on upper airway dimensions in growing class III patients: a retrospective study.,"The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of SEC III (Splints, Class III Elastics, and Chin cup) protocol on the upper airway dimensions using lateral cephalometric radiographs. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the skeletal and dental effects of the SEC III protocol using lateral cephalometric radiographs. The pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalometric radiographs of 24 patients treated using the SEC III protocol were used to address the aim of the study. Children in the pre-pubertal (CS-1 or CS-2) or circumpubertal (CS-3 or CS-4) skeletal maturation stage and having class III dentoskeletal malocclusion were included in the study. Patients with a history of previous orthodontic treatment, maxillofacial surgery or trauma, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or craniofacial malformations were excluded. The pre-treatment and post-treatment lateral cephalometric radiographs were traced, then airway measurements, skeletal measurements, and dental measurements were performed. The results were analysed using paired samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test according to the data normality. Data of 6 males and 18 females were analysed (Mean age = 11.21 ± 1.02 years). Duration of active treatment was 5.75 ± 1.03 months. Treatment using SEC III protocol resulted in a significant increase in ANB angle (2.92 ± 1.50 degrees, p < 0.001) and Wits appraisal (3.31 ± 1.99 mm) (p < 0.001). The increase in the mandibular plane angle (0.75 ± 1.42 degrees, p = 0.02) and the maxillary length (2.29 ± 2.69 mm, p < 0.001) was statistically significant. Contrarily, the mandibular length did not change significantly (p = 0.10). The maxillary incisors were significantly proclined (4.38 ± 4.28 degrees; p < 0.001), while the mandibular incisors were significantly retroclined (-5.79 ± 6.21 degrees; p < 0.001) following treatment. The change in the nasopharyngeal airway and the retropalatal airway was not statistically significant. The middle and inferior pharyngeal space (retroglossal airway) significantly decreased by 1.33 ± 1.97 mm (p = 0.003) and 1.96 ± 2.48 mm (p = 0.001), respectively. Early class III correction using SEC III protocol reduced the retroglossal airway dimensions but did not affect the nasopharyngeal and retropalatal airway dimensions. Correction of the class III dentoskeletal relationship was obtained through both skeletal and dental changes.","D008297:Male;D002648:Child;D005260:Female;D006801:Humans;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D009666:Nose;D008313:Malocclusion, Angle Class III;D008437:Maxilla;D010614:Pharynx;D002508:Cephalometry;D008334:Mandible",trauma
Comparison of short-term efficacy analysis of medium-rectal cancer surgery with robotic natural orifice specimen extraction and robotic transabdominal specimen extraction.,"With the development of minimally invasive technology, the trauma caused by surgery get smaller, At the same time, the specimen extraction surgery through the natural orifice is more favored by experts domestically and abroad, robotic surgery has further promoted the development of specimen extraction surgery through the natural orifice. The aim of current study is to compare the short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSES ) and transabdominal specimen extraction(TRSE ) in median rectal cancer surgery. From January 2020 to January 2023, 87 patients who underwent the NOSES or TRSE at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were included in the study, 4 patients were excluded due to liver metastasis. Of these, 50 patients were in the TRSE and 33 patients in the NOSES. Short-term efficacy was compared in the two groups. The NOSES group had less operation time (P < 0.001), faster recovery of gastrointestinal function (P < 0.001), shorter abdominal incisions (P < 0.001), lower pain scores(P < 0.001). lower Inflammatory indicators of the white blood cell count and C-reactive protein content at 1, 3, and 5 days after surgery (P < 0.001, P = 0.037). There were 9 complications in the NOSES group and 11 complications in the TRSE group(P = 0.583). However, there were no wound complications in the NOSES group. The number of postoperative hospital stays seems to be same in the two groups. And there was no significant difference in postoperative anus function (P = 0.591). This study shows that NOSES and TRSE can achieve similar radical treatment effects, NOSES is a feasible and safe way to take specimens for rectal cancer surgery in accordance with the indication for NOSES.",D006801:Humans;D065287:Robotic Surgical Procedures;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D010535:Laparoscopy;D012004:Rectal Neoplasms;D012007:Rectum;D016896:Treatment Outcome,trauma
Impact of a surfer rescue training program in Australia and New Zealand: a mixed methods evaluation.,"Surfers play a critical role in coastal drowning prevention, conservatively estimated to make as many rescues as beach lifeguards. The Surfer Rescue 24/7 (SR24/7) program is a coastal safety intervention in Australia and New Zealand that teaches surfers safe rescue skills and promotes prevention activities. This multi-part, mixed-methods study aimed to evaluate the impact of the SR24/7 program. The study consisted of three parts employing quantitative and qualitative methods: a retrospective survey of course participants, in-depth interviews with course participants who had conducted rescues, and an analysis of self-reported skills confidence ratings before and after the program. Triangulated results from the three study components indicated that after the course, participants exhibited high levels of satisfaction with their experience in the program and would encourage others to attend, were more observant and aware of safety concerns while surfing, had a better understanding of ocean conditions and hazards, learned new rescue techniques and skills, grasped important course concepts related to their own personal safety, and improved their confidence in responding to an emergency situation. Several participants had conducted rescues in real life and indicated that the course was effective in providing them with the baseline knowledge and skills to keep safe while helping others in the ocean. This study also provides new insight on the role of surfers in coastal safety, specifically that surfers are engaged in a range of prevention activities before rescue is required. Despite persistent challenges in combating coastal drowning rates, the SR24/7 program is an effective intervention that helps save lives. Importantly, this study provides evidence that the course successfully equips surfers with techniques to act responsibly and safely. Expanding coastal safety focus and resources towards surfers, an often-overlooked demographic in beach safety strategies, could substantially enhance community-level capacity to prevent and respond to ocean emergencies.",D006801:Humans;D004332:Drowning;D009520:New Zealand;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D013177:Sports;D001315:Australia,trauma
Is there structural change on MRI in gluteal tendinopathy after treatment? Single outcome measure extension of an RCT.,"The etiology of tendinopathy remains controversial and it is unknown whether degenerative structural changes in tendinopathies are reversible. There will be no structural change on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken > 2-years after treatment for gluteal tendinopathy. Extension of a single site, double-blind, prospective randomized-controlled trial to analyze the additional outcome measure; MRI changes. University of Melbourne ethics approval number: 1852900, trial registration: ACTRN12613000677707. Participants with gluteal tendinopathy who had previously received a leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma injection (LR-PRP) or a corticosteroid injection (CSI) had a post treatment MRI between at least 2-years and up to 7 years following trial completion. A blinded, senior musculoskeletal radiologist graded all de-identified MRI scans using the Melbourne Hip Score (MHIP). The primary outcome measure was the change in overall pre- and post-treatment score. Participants (n = 20) underwent MRI at mean time of 4.15 (SD 1.11; range 2-7) years after their initial treatment. There was no change in the overall mean MHIP score for the CSI group (Pre 4.3 (SD 2.3) Post 4.3 (SD 1.1), p = 1.00). Although there was an improvement in the LR-PRP group mean MHIP score (Pre 5.3 (SD 3.0) Post 4.77 (SD 2.5), p = 0.56) it was not statistically significant. However, in the LR-PRP intervention group, five out of nine of participants' MHIP score improved, with four of these improving by 2-4 points. The hypothesis that there would be no improvement in MHIP scores following treatment of gluteal tendinopathy was supported. Findings of improvement in the LR-PRP group at 4 years would support further studies powered to look for structural improvement. These findings suggest that structural change following treatment for tendinopathy may be possible supporting the inclusion of MRI as a core outcome for future studies.

Safety and Injury of US Certified Organic Crop Producers in the Southwest Region.,"Literature on occupational risks among organic farmers is scarce. This study explored safety practices and non-fatal injuries among organic producers, and the role of sociodemographic, work, and farm characteristics on safety and injury. Cross sectional survey of certified organic crop producers in the Southwest (SW) region of the United States (US). The Organic Integrity Database was used for recruitment. Data were collected through an electronic and paper survey. Analyses were conducted on 115 cases; response rate was estimated at 25%. A high majority of respondents owned their operation and were younger than 65 years, male, educated beyond high-school, and non-Hispanic whites. Less than half had more than 10 years of experience in organic farming; one-third worked off the farm year-round. Safety practices were very basic despite the widespread use of equipment and machinery, and limited to wearing normal clothing and apparel such hats and glasses. About half of respondents (52.6%) reported non-fatal injuries in the past year; and one-third (32.7%) time lost due to injuries. Overall cumulative incidence rate was estimated at 5.3 injuries per 10 workers within the last year. The injury rate decreased with hours worked. Significant differences were found on gender and education level and safety practices, with female respondents and the more educated being more proactive in practicing safety. Those working less than 40 hours/week, in farms smaller than 50 acres, using light machinery or compact utility tractors, and tractors without roll-over protection reported significantly higher injury frequency compared to their counterparts. This study contributes unique data on an essential workforce not captured by current occupational injury and illness surveillance systems. It identifies important personal and contextual factors that may contribute to safety and injury in this population. Findings indicate the need to promote safety and prevent injuries that result in work time lost. This study may also inform future occupational safety and health research and practice, including surveillance, injury prevention programs that target certain workers and production practices, and policies that support and protect the organic farmer.",Organic producers;occupational injury;safety;sociodemographic characteristics,trauma
Pertrochanteric hip fracture is associated with mobility decline and poorer physical performance 4 to 6 months post-hip fracture.,"To study the effect of hip fracture type on physical performance, functional ability and change in mobility four to six months after the injury. A total of 1331 patients out of consecutive 2052 patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent hip fracture surgery were included in the study. Patient information was collected on admission, during hospitalization, by phone interview and at the geriatric outpatient clinic 4 to 6 months after the fracture. Of the 1331 eligible patients, Grip strength, Timed Up and Go -test (TUG), Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS), mobility change compared to pre-fracture mobility level, Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) were used to determine physical performance and functional ability. Logistic regression was used for the analyses which was adjusted for gender, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, diagnosis of cognitive disorder, pre-fracture living arrangements, mobility and need of mobility aid. Patients with pertrochanteric hip fracture had an EMS lower than 14 (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.38, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.00-1.90), TUG time ≥ 20 s (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.22-2.33) and they had declined in mobility (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20-2.09) compared to femoral neck fracture patients 4 to 6 months post-hip fracture in multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses. Grip strength and functional ability (IADL, BADL) 4 to 6 months after hip fracture did not differ between fracture types. There were no statistically significant differences in physical performance in patients with a subtrochanteric fracture compared to patients with a femoral neck fracture. Pertrochanteric hip fracture independently associated with poorer physical performance 4 to 6 months post hip fracture compared to other hip fracture types. Pertrochanteric hip fracture patients should be given special attention in terms of regaining their previous level of mobility.",D000368:Aged;D006801:Humans;D000203:Activities of Daily Living;D011446:Prospective Studies;D006620:Hip Fractures;D005265:Femoral Neck Fractures;D006760:Hospitalization,trauma
How the forensic multidisciplinary approach can solve a fatal dog pack attack.,"The authors present the case of a 61-year-old man found dead in an agricultural plot. The first investigation of the scene revealed the corpse laid face up in a spot of partially dried blood, next to an olive tree. His face, arms, legs, and abdomen showed signs of severe contusion and laceration of dogs' bite wounds. Next to the victim, an olives bin had been found overturned on the ground. A multi-disciplinary approach, including crime scene analysis, autopsy findings, veterinary animals review, odontologist bite mark study, and forensic genetics DNA correlations, was performed. The present case is a documented watchdogs lethal pack attack and provides an example of how to recognize the more active participants thanks to their odontological alterations. It could be considered the first described dog pack attack case solved by dysgnathia alteration. Comparisons between the dental casts obtained from the dogs and the inflicted wounds were made, resulting in positive correlations between the injuries and the dental arches from two of the six involved dogs, thanks to dental abnormalities and DNA founding. The victim's clothes were also compared with the dogs' dental casts, confirming that they were the most active participants during the pack attack. Dogs' DNA was finally matched with saliva traces found on victim's clothes and skin bite marks.",Autopsy;Dog DNA identification;Dog bites;Dog territory defense;Fatal dog attack;Forensic science,trauma
Mid-term clinical and sonographic outcomes of minimally invasive acromioclavicular joint reconstruction: mini-open versus arthroscopically assisted.,"The current literature describes various operative stabilization strategies which achieve good clinical outcomes after acute acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocation. The aim of this study was to compare the mid-term clinical and sonographic treatment outcomes after minimally invasive mini-open and arthroscopic reconstruction. We conducted a retrospective two-center study of patients with acute ACJ dislocation. Surgical treatment was performed using either a mini-open approach (MIOP) or an arthroscopic technique (AR). The primary outcome parameters of this study were the sonographically measured acromioclavicular (ACD) and coracoclavicular distances (CCD). Secondary outcome parameters included the Constant-Murley score (CS), range of motion (ROM), postoperative pain scale (VAS), return to daily routine, return to sports, complications, as well as operative revisions. After a mean follow-up of 29 months, 30 patients were included in this study with an average age of 41.3 ± 14.8 years (MIOP) and 41.2 ± 15.4 years (AR). The sonographic ACD (MIOP 9.11 mm vs. AR 8.93 mm, p = 0.41) and CCD (MIOP 25.08 mm vs. AR 24.36 mm, p = 0.29) distances showed no statistically significant differences. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference when compared to the contralateral side (p = 0.42). With both techniques, patients achieved excellent clinical outcome parameters without statistically significant differences in CS (MIOP 95 vs. AR 97, p = 0.11) and VAS (MIOP 1.76 vs. AR 1.14, p = 0.18). The return to daily activity and return to sport rates did not differ. There were neither complications nor revisions in both groups. Both minimally invasive techniques for acute ACJ stabilization achieved excellent clinical and sonographic outcomes without one technique being statistically superior to the other.",AC joint dislocation;AC joint stabilization;Acute,trauma
A novel computed tomography-based three-column MLP classification of intertrochanteric fracture.,"The aim of the present study was to introduce a novel three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT)-based three-column classification (named ""MLP classification system"") of intertrochanteric fractures and evaluate its reproducibility and reliability. From September 2020 to September 2022, a total of 258 consecutive patients (60 male, 198 female;mean age 81.3 years) with intertrochanteric fractures were included in this study. The fracture in each case was assessed using a novel three-dimensional computed tomography-based three-column classification. Two examiners tested the intra and inter-observer reliability of this new classification system using kappa variance. The intertrochanteric region was divided into the medial column, lateral column, and posterior column. Intertrochanteric fractures were documented as M0/1/2L0/1/2/3P0/1/2/3. All fractures were classifiable into the new classification system. The intra-observer kappa values were 0.91 and 0.89, while the inter-observer kappa value was 0.82, both indicating almost perfect reliability. This novel 3DCT-based MLP classification system for intertrochanteric fractures is comprehensive, and reproducible with good agreement. It is based on proximal femur biomechanic characteristics and traumatic mechanism, contributing to formulating more reasonable treatment protocols involving various late-model internal fixation devices.

Differences in incidence rate and onset timing of undiagnosed finger symptom among shoulder surgeries related to complex regional pain syndrome.,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the difference in onset timing and incidence of undiagnosed finger symptom (UDFS) between various shoulder surgical procedures. In this study, UDFS symptoms included the following four symptoms in the fingers;edema, limited range-of-motion, skin color changes, and abnormal sensations. UDFS cases were defined as those presenting with at least one UDFS. In result, the incidence rate of UDFS cases was 7.1% overall (58/816 shoulders), 7.4% (32/432) in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR), 9.0% (11/122) in open rotator cuff repair (ORCR), 1.4% (2/145) in arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD), 13.2% (5/38) in open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), 11.1% (3/27) in humeral head replacement, 4.8% (1/21) in anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty, and 12.9% (4/31) in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty cases. The Rate was significantly higher with ARCR compared to ASD (p<.01). About onset timing in weeks postoperatively, the ORIF group had a statistically earlier symptom onset than the Rotator cuff repair (ARCR + ORCR) group (2.4 weeks vs. 6.0 weeks, p<.01). When classifying the onset timing into before and after the removal of the abduction pillow, the ORIF group showed a statistically higher rate of onset before brace removal than the Rotator cuff repair groups (p<.01). Differences in UDFS among shoulder surgeries were demonstrated in this study. J. Med.

Evaluating a digital hybrid training-of-trainers (TOT) approach for lay first responder trauma education in urban Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the largest contributor to the global burden of injury, and in 2016 were among the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In regions with limited emergency medical services (EMS), training lay first responders (LFRs) has been shown to increase availability of prehospital care for RTIs, but sustainable mechanisms to scale these programs remain unstudied. Using a training of trainers (TOT) model, a 5.5-h LFR training program was launched in Lagos, Nigeria. The course was taught in a hybrid fashion with primary didactics using videoconferencing software and practical breakout sessions in-person concurrently. Thirty TOTs proceeded to train 350 transportation providers as LFRs over one month. A 23-question, pre- and post-assessment was administered digitally to assess knowledge acquisition. Participants responded to a five-point Likert survey assessing instruction quality and post-course confidence. TOTs scored a median of 56.5 % (IQR:43.5 %,71.7 %) and 91.3 % (IQR:88.0 %,95.7 %) on the pre- and post-assessments, respectively, with bleeding control scores increasing most (+69.4 %). LFR course trainees scored a median of 34.8 % (IQR: 26.0 %, 43.5 %) and 73.9 % (IQR: 65.2 %, 82.6 %) on the pre- and post-assessments respectively, with airway and breathing increasing the most (+48.6 %). All score increases were statistically significant with p < 0.001. All 30 TOT trainers instructed at least one training session after their initial session. LFR participants' rated confidence in first aid skills went from 3/5 (IQR 3, 4) pre-course to 5/5 (IQR:5,5) post-course, and in emergency transportation it went from 4/5 (IQR:3, 4) to 5/5 (IQR:5, 5), (p < 0.001). LFR course participants rated the quality of education content and TOT instructors to be 5/5 (IQR:5,5). 144 responders provided emergency care in the six-months following training for a total of 351 interventions. Active responders provided a median of 2 (IQR:1,3) interventions. This is the first time that a digital hybrid instruction for first responder trainers in low- and middle-income countries has been investigated. Our findings demonstrate negligible attrition, high educational quality ratings, equally effective knowledge acquisition to that of prior in-person courses, and high post-training skill usage. Future work will examine the cost-effectiveness of the training of LFRs and the effect of LFRs on trauma outcomes.",Acute care;First responder;Prehospital;Road traffic injury;Trauma care;Virtual education,trauma
"Fatal occupational injuries in North Carolina, 1992-2017.","After declining for several decades, fatal occupational injury rates have stagnated in the USA since 2009. To revive advancements in workplace safety, interventions targeting at-risk worker groups must be implemented. Our study aims to identify these at-risk populations by evaluating disparities in unintentional occupational fatalities occurring in North Carolina (NC) from 1992 to 2017. Our retrospective cohort study drew on both the NC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner system and the NC death certificate data system to identify unintentional fatal occupational injuries occurring from 1992 to 2017. Unintentional fatal occupational injury rates were reported across industries, occupations and demographic groups, and rate ratios were calculated to assess disparities. Among those aged 18 and older, 2645 unintentional fatal occupational injuries were identified. Fatal occupational injury rates declined by 0.82 injuries/100 000 person-years over this period, falling consistently from 2004 to 2009 and increasing from 2009 to 2017. Fatal injury rates were highest among Hispanic workers, who experienced 2.75 times the fatal injury rate of non-Hispanic White workers (95% CI 2.42 to 3.11) and self-employed workers, who experienced 1.44 times the fatal injury rate of private workers (95% CI 1.29 to 1.60). We also observed that fatal injury rates increased with age group and were higher among male relative to female workers even after adjustment for differential distributions across occupations. The decline in unintentional fatal occupational injury rates over this period is encouraging, but the increase in injury rate after 2009 and the large disparities between occupations, industries and demographic groups highlight the need for additional targeted safety interventions.",Accidents;Epidemiology;Occupational Health;Public health,trauma

Neurological injury following peripheral nerve blocks: a narrative review of estimates of risks and the influence of ultrasound guidance.,"Peripheral nerve injury or post-block neurological dysfunction (PBND) are uncommon but a recognized complications of peripheral nerve blocks (PNB). A broad range of its incidence is noted in the literature and hence a critical appraisal of its occurrence is needed. In this review, we wanted to know the pooled estimates of PBND and further, determine its pooled estimates following various PNB over time. Additionally, we also sought to estimate the incidence of PBND with or without US guidance. A literature search was conducted in six databases. For the purposes of the review, we defined PBND as any new-onset sensorimotor disturbances in the distribution of the performed PNB either attributable to the PNB (when reported) or reported in the context of the PNB (when association with a PNB was not mentioned). Both prospective and retrospective studies which provided incidence of PBND at timepoints of interest (>48 hours to <2 weeks; >2 weeks to 6 weeks, 7 weeks to 5 months, 6 months to 1 year and >1 year durations) were included for review. Incidence data were used to provide pooled estimates (with 95% CI) of PBND at these time periods. Similar estimates were obtained to know the incidence of PBND with or without the use of US guidance. Additionally, PBND associated with individual PNB were obtained in a similar fashion with upper and lower limb PNB classified based on the anatomical location of needle insertion. The overall incidence of PBND decreased with time, with the incidence being approximately 1% at <2 weeks' time (Incidence per thousand (95% CI)= 9 (8; to 11)) to approximately 3/10 000 at 1 year (Incidence per thousand (95% CI)= 0. 3 (0.1; to 0.5)). Incidence of PBND differed for individual PNB with the highest incidence noted for interscalene block. Our review adds information to existing literature that the neurological complications are rarer but seem to display a higher incidence for some blocks more than others. Use of US guidance may be associated with a lower incidence of PBND especially in those PNBs reporting a higher pooled estimates. Future studies need to standardize the reporting of PBND at various timepoints and its association to PNB.","Anesthesia, Conduction;Anesthesia, Local;Nerve Block;Peripheral Nerve Injuries;REGIONAL ANESTHESIA",trauma
Thoracic splenosis: an important consideration in oncology patients.,"SummarySplenosis is the implantation of ectopic splenic tissue after splenic injury or splenectomy. Signs and symptoms of splenosis vary based on anatomic location; however, it remains asymptomatic in many cases. On radiographic imaging, splenosis often appears as a soft tissue mass and can be diagnosed using heat-damaged red blood cell scintigraphy, a non-invasive imaging modality. Radiographic findings of splenosis on imaging may be suspicious for metastatic disease in patients with known solid organ tumours. It is important to have a high degree of suspicion for splenosis with known history of splenic trauma or splenectomy in order to avoid invasive procedures and guide appropriate management.",D006801:Humans;D017890:Splenosis;D013156:Splenectomy;D009369:Neoplasms;D000007:Abdominal Injuries,trauma
PAEDIATRIC VASCULAR SURGERY: A review of cases from a dedicated paediatric vascular surgery clinic.,"The experience in paediatric vascular diseases is limited in the UK and worldwide due to their rarity and variations in practice. We looked at types of cases presenting to a dedicated paediatric vascular clinic. Medical records of children seen in a dedicated paediatric vascular clinic at a tertiary referral service between 2016 and 2022 were reviewed. These patients were either seen for the first time in that clinic or had their appointments as a follow up after inpatient review or intervention while being under care of paediatric teams in local hospitals. 55 patients (34 males) were seen aged between 4 months and 17 years (mean 9.5 years). Common presentations were limb length discrepancy secondary to iatrogenic arterial occlusion, follow up after bypass for trauma, lower limb swelling or discolouration and varicose veins. Operative procedures included lower limb bypass, angioplasty, ligation of aneurysms and varicose vein surgery. Paediatric vascular conditions are uncommon and therefore most vascular surgeons and trainees will have little exposure to such cases. Intervention is needed for arterial injury secondary to penetrating or iatrogenic trauma. National registry is required for these rare cases to gain prospective data that can help build up more evidence for educational purposes and to establish guidelines.",Paediatric;children;peripheral arterial disease (PAD);vascular disease;vascular trauma,trauma
The mediating role of childhood maltreatment in the association between residence migration and adolescent depression.,"It is well established that residence migration can negatively affect the mental health of adolescents. However, the related factors that mediate the association between residence migration and depression are still uncertain. The participants were 16,037 adolescents in junior middle schools. A self-administered questionnaire was used for the survey. In addition to collecting general demographic characteristics of the participants, including age, gender, local residence status, only child status, parental marriage status and parent-child relationship, the questionnaire also contained the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software. A total of 14,059 valid questionnaires were collected, resulting in 12,122 local adolescents, defined as being born and raised locally, and 1937 migrant adolescents, defined as being transferred from other regions. Meanwhile, 53.3 % of local adolescents and 58.2 % of migrant adolescents reported depressive symptoms. This result indicated that residence migration might contribute to depression symptoms(OR = 1.136, 95%CI: 1.013-1.273, p < 0.05). Childhood maltreatment and parental divorce are risk factors for depression in migrant adolescents. For all adolescents, resilience and a good parent-child relationship may reduce the risk of depression. Childhood maltreatment completely mediates residence migration-related depression(95 % bootstrap CI = 0.146, 0.323). This study revealed that residence migration could contribute to adolescent depression, and childhood maltreatment may largely mediate this process, providing new insight into the relationship between adolescent depressive symptoms and residence migration. Reducing childhood maltreatment may effectively improve the depressive symptoms of migrant adolescents.",Adolescent depression symptoms;Childhood maltreatment;Mediation;Migration,trauma
Design and synthesis of sirtinol analogs as human neutrophil elastase inhibitors.,"Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) overexpression has a crucial role in most acute inflammation and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency syndromes observed in humans, triggering neutrophil invasion and activation of macrophage inflammatory and proteolytic effects, leading to tissue damage. Manipulating HNE level homeostasis could potentially help treat neutrophilic inflammation. Previous studies have shown that sirtinol (1) has a specific influence on HNE and potently attenuates acute lung injury and hepatic injury mediated by lipopolysaccharide or trauma hemorrhage. Therefore, 1 was chosen as the model structure to obtain more potent anti-HNE agents. In the present study, we synthesized a series of sirtinol analogues and determined their inhibitory effects on HNE. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies showed that swapping the imine and methyl groups of the sirtinol scaffold with diazene and carboxyl groups, respectively, enhances the HNE inhibiting potency. Compound 29 exhibited the highest potency in the SAR study and showed dual inhibitory effects on HNE and proteinase 3 with IC50 values of 4.91 and 20.69 µM, respectively. Furthermore, 29 was confirmed to have dual impacts on inhibiting O2•- generation and elastase release in cell-based assays with IC50 values of 0.90 and 1.86 µM, respectively. These findings suggest that 29 is a promising candidate for developing HNE inhibitors in the treatment of neutrophilic inflammatory diseases.","Neutrophilic inflammatory diseases, human neutrophil elastase;Sirtinol analogs;Structure–activity relationship (SAR)",trauma
Gallic acid exerts protective effects in spinal cord injured rats through modulating microglial polarization.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly traumatic injury that causes mechanical damage to the spinal cord. Our study aimed to investigate whether gallic acid has protective effects against SCI injury. Adult male rats were subjected to contusive spinal cord injuries. For behavioural evaluation, the rats were given gallic acid by i.p. injection at the doses of 10, 50 or 100 mg/kg immediately after SCI once daily for consecutive 28 days. Behavioral tests were used to evaluate locomotor functions, mechanical sensitivity and nerve conduction functions. For biochemical experiments, the rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, SCI group and SCI+gallic acid group. The rats in the SCI+gallic acid group were given gallic acid at the dose of 100 mg/kg immediately after SCI once daily for consecutive 14 days. The levels of inflammatory factors were evaluated. Gallic acid treatment could improve locomotive and sensory function and reduce the functional impairments in SCI rats. The effects were more effective with increasing gallic acid dose. The levels of M1 markers (inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2) were decreased in gallic acid-treated SCI rats, whereas the levels of M2 markers (arginase 1 and cluster of differentiation 206) were increased in response to gallic acid administration. Gallic acid treatment resulted in a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. Gallic acid enhances the recovery in SCI rats by regulating microglial polarization. The underlying mechanism may involve the promotion of M2 polarization and the suppression of M1 polarization in microglia.",Gallic acid;M1;M2;Spinal cord injure;microglia;polarization,trauma
Adventitial delivery of miR-145 to treat intimal hyperplasia post vascular injuries through injectable and in-situ self-assembling peptide hydrogels.,"Intimal hyperplasia is a common lesion that can be observed in diverse vascular diseases. Drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons, which can release anti-proliferative agents to inhibit smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, are developed to prevent intimal hyperplasia. However, these intervention devices still cannot achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes. In contrast to endovascular drug delivery, vascular adventitial drug delivery is a new strategy. To develop a vascular adventitial drug delivery system to treat intimal hyperplasia post vascular injuries, we loaded miR-145-5p-agomir (miR-145) into an injectable and in-situ self-assembling RAD peptide hydrogel. In vitro data showed that the miR-145 could be well incorporated into the RAD peptide hydrogels and released in a slow and controlled manner. The released miR-145 could transfect SMCs successfully, and the transfected SMCs exhibited a reduced migration capacity and higher expressions of SMC contractile biomarkers as compared to the non-transfected SMCs. In vivo data showed that the retention of the miR-145 was greatly elongated by the RAD peptide hydrogels. In addition, the application of the miR-145-loaded RAD peptide hydrogels surrounding injured arteries decreased the proliferative SMCs, promoted the regeneration of endothelium, reduced the macrophage infiltration, inhibited the neointimal formation and prevented adverse ECM remodeling via downregulation of KLF4 expression. The RAD peptide hydrogels loaded with miR-145 can successfully inhibit intimal hyperplasia after vascular injuries and thus hold great potential as an innovative extravascular drug delivery approach to treat vascular diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Intimal hyperplasia is a common lesion that can be observed in diverse vascular diseases. Drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons, which can release anti-proliferative agents to inhibit smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, are developed to prevent intimal hyperplasia.

Factors associated with healthcare utilization for infant falls in South Korea: a cross-sectional online survey.,"Falls are a common cause of unintentional injuries in infants. This study was conducted to examine the patterns of healthcare utilization following infant falls in South Korea. This cross-sectional descriptive study utilized an online survey designed to gather information regarding the general characteristics of parents and infants, fall-related variables, and healthcare use. The most serious falls identified by parents occurred at an average infant age of 6.97 months. Most fall incidents took place indoors (95.7%), and many occurred under the supervision of caregivers (68.0%). Following the fall, 36.4% of the participants used healthcare services. Logistic regression analysis revealed that healthcare use following an infant fall was significantly associated with being a firstborn child (odds ratio [OR]=5.32, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.19-15.28) and falling from a caregiver's arms (OR=4.22; 95% CI, 1.45-13.68).

Toxoplasma gondii IgG Serointensity Is Positively Associated With Frailty.,"Persistent inflammation related to aging (""inflammaging"") is exacerbated by chronic infections and contributes to frailty in older adults. We hypothesized associations between Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), a common parasite causing an oligosymptomatic unremitting infection, and frailty, and secondarily between T. gondii and previously reported markers of immune activation in frailty. We analyzed available demographic, social, and clinical data in Spanish and Portuguese older adults [N = 601; age: mean (SD) 77.3 (8.0); 61% women]. Plasma T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) serointensity was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Fried criteria were used to define frailty status. Validated translations of Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index were used to evaluate confounders. Previously analyzed biomarkers that were significantly associated with frailty in both prior reports and the current study, and also related to T. gondii serointensity, were further accounted for in multivariable logistic models with frailty as outcome. In T. gondii-seropositives, there was a significant positive association between T. gondii IgG serointensity and frailty, accounting for age (p = .0002), and resisting adjustment for multiple successive confounders. Among biomarkers linked with frailty, kynurenine/tryptophan and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II were positively associated with T. gondii serointensity in seropositives (p < .05). Associations with other biomarkers were not significant. This first reported association between T. gondii and frailty is limited by a cross-sectional design and warrants replication. While certain biomarkers of inflammaging were associated with both T. gondii IgG serointensity and frailty, they did not fully mediate the T. gondii-frailty association.",Chronic toxoplasmosis;Inflammaging;Kynurenine to tryptophan ratio;sTNF-RII,trauma
Predictors of mortality in periprosthetic fractures of the hip: Results from the national PPF study.,"Periprosthetic fractures (PPFs) around the hip joint are increasing in prevalence. In this collaborative study, we aimed to investigate the impact of patient demographics, fracture characteristics, and modes of management on in-hospital mortality of PPFs involving the hip. Using a multi-centre cohort study design, we retrospectively identified adults presenting with a PPF around the hip over a 10-year period. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to study the independent correlation between patient, fracture, and treatment factors on mortality. A total of 1,109 patients were included. The in-hospital mortality rate was 5.3%. Multivariable analyses suggested that age, male sex, abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), pneumonia, renal failure, history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and deep surgical site infection were each independently associated with mortality. Each yearly increase in age independently correlates with a 7% increase in mortality (OR 1.07, p=0.019). The odds of mortality was 2.99 times higher for patients diagnosed with pneumonia during their hospital stay [OR 2.99 (95% CI 1.07-8.37) p=0.037], and 7.25 times higher for patients that developed renal failure during their stay [OR 7.25 (95% CI 1.85-28.47) p=0.005]. Patients with history of PVD have a six-fold greater mortality risk (OR 6.06, p=0.003). Mode of treatment was not a significant predictor of mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate of PPFs around the hip exceeds 5%. The fracture subtype and mode of management are not independent predictors of mortality, while patient factors such as age, AMTS, history of PVD, pneumonia, and renal failure can independently predict mortality. Peri-operative optimisation of modifiable risk factors such as lung and kidney function in patients with PPFs around the hip during their hospital stay is of utmost importance.",Periprosthetic;arthroplasty;fracture;mortality,trauma
Nrf2 for a key member of redox regulation: A novel insight against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injuries.,"Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), a nuclear transcription factor, modulates genes responsible for antioxidant responses against toxic and oxidative stress to maintain redox homeostasis and participates in varieties of cellular processes such as metabolism and inflammation during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injuries (MIRI). The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from damaged mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidases, and inflammation contributes to depraved myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injuries. Considering that Nrf2 played crucial roles in antagonizing oxidative stress, it is reasonable to delve into the up or down-regulated molecular mechanisms of Nrf2 in the progression of MIRI to provide the possibility of new therapeutic medicine targeting Nrf2 in cardiovascular diseases. This review systematically describes the generation of ROS, the regulatory metabolisms of Nrf2 as well as several natural or synthetic compounds activating Nrf2 during MIRI, which might provide novel insights for the anti-oxidative stress and original ideas targeting Nrf2 for the prevention and treatment in cardiovascular diseases.",Antioxidation;Lipid peroxidation;Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injuries;Nrf2;ROS,trauma

In vitro validation: GLY alleviates UV-induced corneal epithelial damage through the HMGB1-TLR/MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway.,"UV-induced corneal damage is a common ocular surface injury that usually leads to corneal lesions causing persistent inflammation. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is identified as an inflammatory alarm in various tissue injuries. Here, this study first evaluates the repair effect of the HMGB1-selective inhibitor GLY in UV-induced corneal damage; Secondly, the inhibitory effect of GLY on UV-induced corneal damage induced inflammation and the potential therapeutic mechanism of GLY were studied. GLY effectively attenuates the expression of UV-induced inflammatory factors and HMGB1, TLR/MyD88, NF-κB signaling pathway genes at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, RT-PCR and Western Blot experiments after knocking down HMGB1 and TLR2/9 genes showed that GLY alleviated corneal inflammation by inhibiting the HMGB1-TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway. The results of this study show that targeting HMGB1-NF-κB by GLY can alleviate the inflammatory response induced by UV induction.",Corneal epithelial cells;GLY;HMGB1;Inflammation;UV,trauma
Impact of pharmacists during in-hospital resuscitation or medical emergency response events: A systematic review.,"We sought to determine the impact of the presence of a pharmacist on medication and patient related outcomes during the emergency management of critically ill patients requiring resuscitation or medical emergency response team care in a hospital setting. We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A literature search of databases from January 1995 to April 2023 was conducted to identify studies of contemporary pharmacist practice. Results were extracted and analysed for included studies, those evaluating the impact of the presence of a pharmacist on medication and patient related outcomes during the emergency management of critically ill hospitalised patients requiring resuscitation or medical emergency response team care. To determine risk of bias, the Newcastle-Ottowa Quality Assessment scale was used for non-randomised studies and the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. Of 1345 studies identified, 54 were selected for full text review, and 30 were included in the final analysis. There were 29 cohort studies and one randomised controlled trial. The studies reported the impact of a pharmacist for a variety of patient presentations. The study team assigned each study to one of eight patient cohorts: acute stroke, cardiac arrest, rapid response calls, S-T segment elevation myocardial infarction, acute haemorrhage, major trauma resuscitation, sepsis and status epilepticus. The most frequently reported outcome, associated with a statistically significant benefit in 23 studies, was time to medication administration. Few studies reported a significant difference in patient outcome measures such as mortality. Only 8 of the 30 studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias. The results of this systematic review provide support for a beneficial impact of a pharmacist presence and intervention during resuscitation or medical emergency response team care, with significant improvements in outcomes such as time to initiation of time-critical medications, medication appropriateness and guideline compliance. However, studies were predominantly small and retrospective and were not powered to detect differences in patient related measures such as length of stay and mortality. Future research should investigate the clinical impacts of the pharmacist in ED resuscitation settings in controlled, prospective studies with robust sampling methods.",Acute ischemic stroke;Acute severe haemorrhage;Emergency critical care;Pharmacist;Resuscitation;Sepsis,trauma
Adverse childhood experiences and residential care environment: The mediating role of trauma-related symptoms and psychological maladjustment in adolescents.,"Research has consistently found poorer outcomes in adolescents who have been exposed to early interpersonal adversities, especially those in out-of-home placements. The presence of mental health problems also contributes to the perception of a more negative group climate and peer interactions through cascading effects. To analyze the sequential relationships between exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), trauma-related symptoms, psychological maladjustment, and the perception of group climate and peer interactions. In addition, the study analyzes the mediating role of trauma-related symptoms and psychological maladjustment. The sample comprised 161 adolescents in out-of-home care (46.6 % males, 49.7 % females, 3.7 % non-binary), aged 12-18 (M = 15.22, SD = 1.59) from 24 residential facilities in Spain. This study is part of the VRINEP project. Group care workers reported about ACEs and trauma-related symptoms through online questionnaires, whereas adolescents self-reported about psychological maladjustment, group climate, and peer interactions. Differential associations between ACEs with trauma-related symptoms and internalizing problems were found. The relationship between certain ACEs and externalizing problems was fully mediated by trauma-related symptoms. Likewise, psychological maladjustment was related to a more negative perception of the group climate and peer interactions. Although trauma-related symptoms were not directly associated with the perception of the residential environment, they were indirectly associated with peer relational aggression through externalizing problems. Mental health has a significant impact on the perception of the group climate and peer interactions among adolescents in residential care who have been exposed to ACEs.",ACEs;Adolescents;Group climate;Mental health;Out-of-home care;Trauma,trauma
Bioprinting of scaled-up meniscal grafts by spatially patterning phenotypically distinct meniscus progenitor cells within melt electrowritten scaffolds.,"Meniscus injuries are a common problem in orthopedic medicine and are associated with a significantly increased risk of developing osteoarthritis. While developments have been made in the field of meniscus regeneration, the engineering of cell-laden constructs that mimic the complex structure, composition and biomechanics of the native tissue remains a significant challenge. This can be linked to the use of cells that are not phenotypically representative of the different zones of the meniscus, and an inability to direct the spatial organization of engineered meniscal tissues. In this study we investigated the potential of zone-specific meniscus progenitor cells (MPCs) to generate functional meniscal tissue following their deposition into MEW scaffolds. We first confirmed that fibronectin selected MPCs from the inner and outer regions of the meniscus maintain their differentiation capacity with prolonged monolayer expansion, opening their use within advanced biofabrication strategies. By depositing MPCs within MEW scaffolds with elongated pore shapes, which functioned as physical boundaries to direct cell growth and extracellular matrix production, we were able to bioprint anisotropic fibrocartilaginous tissues with preferentially aligned collagen networks. Furthermore, by using MPCs isolated from the inner (iMPCs) and outer (oMPCs) zone of the meniscus, we were able to bioprint phenotypically distinct constructs mimicking aspects of the native tissue. An iterative MEW process was then implemented to print scaffolds with a similar wedged-shaped profile to that of the native meniscus, into which we deposited iMPCs and oMPCs in a spatially controlled manner. This process allowed us to engineer sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) and collagen rich constructs mimicking the geometry of the meniscus, with MPCs generating a more fibrocartilage-like tissue compared to the mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs). Taken together, these results demonstrate how the convergence of emerging biofabrication platforms with tissue-specific progenitor cells can enable the engineering of complex tissues such as the meniscus.",Bioprinting;Collagen;Melt electrowriting (MEW);Meniscus;Progenitor cells,trauma
"Association Between the New York SAFE Act and Firearm Suicide and Homicide: An Analysis of Synthetic Controls, New York State, 1999‒2019.","Objectives. To assess the association between the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act (NY SAFE Act) and firearm suicide and homicide rates. Methods. We employed a synthetic controls approach to investigate the impact of the NY SAFE Act on firearm suicide and firearm homicide rates. We collected state-level data on firearm mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database for the period 1999-2019. We derived statistical inference by using a permutation-based in-place placebo test. Results. The implementation of the NY SAFE Act was associated with a significant reduction in firearm homicide rates, demonstrating a decrease of 63%. This decrease corresponds to an estimated prevention of 1697 deaths between 2013 and 2019. However, there was no association between the NY SAFE Act and firearm suicide rates. Conclusions. As the responsibility for enacting firearm policies increasingly falls on states instead of the federal government, this study provides valuable information that can assist states in making evidence-based decisions regarding the development and implementation of firearm policies that prioritize public safety and aim to prevent firearm-related fatalities.

Multi-Functional Small Molecule Alleviates Fracture Pain and Promotes Bone Healing.,"Bone injuries such as fractures are one major cause of morbidities worldwide. A considerable number of fractures suffer from delayed healing, and the unresolved acute pain may transition to chronic and maladaptive pain. Current management of pain involves treatment with NSAIDs and opioids with substantial adverse effects. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that the purine molecule, adenosine, can simultaneously alleviate pain and promote healing in a mouse model of tibial fracture by targeting distinctive adenosine receptor subtypes in different cell populations. To achieve this, a biomaterial-assisted delivery of adenosine is utilized to localize and prolong its therapeutic effect at the injury site. The results demonstrate that local delivery of adenosine inhibited the nociceptive activity of peripheral neurons through activation of adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA1) and mitigated pain as demonstrated by weight bearing and open field movement tests. Concurrently, local delivery of adenosine at the fracture site promoted osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells through adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B) resulting in improved bone healing as shown by histological analyses and microCT imaging. This study demonstrates the dual role of adenosine and its material-assisted local delivery as a feasible therapeutic approach to treat bone trauma and associated pain.",adenosine;adenosine receptors;biomaterials;drug delivery;fracture healing;fracture pain;phenylboronic acids,trauma
Cannabis Vape Product Sales in California Following CDC's Initial Advisory About Lung Injuries.,"Introduction: The 2019 outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is believed to have been caused by vitamin E acetate, an additive used in some cannabis vaporizer products. Previous studies have primarily focused on changes in sales of electronic nicotine delivery systems following the initial advisory issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on August 17, 2019. The present study is intended to examine variation by age groups in sales of regulated cannabis vape products in the state of California before, during, and after the outbreak. Methods: Weekly sales revenue of cannabis vape products (from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020) was obtained from a sample of recreational cannabis retailers licensed in California. An interrupted time series analysis, using AutoRegressive, Integrated, Moving Average methods, was employed to estimate changes in the sales and market share of cannabis vape products in the weeks following the CDC advisory. Results: The total volume of regulated cannabis vape product sales increased substantially over the 3-year study period (2018-2020). Sales and market share of cannabis vape products, however, declined in both young and older adults immediately following the advisory, rebounding to pre-EVALI levels only for the young adults. For sales, the potential EVALI effect following the CDC's advisory equates to an 8.0% and 2.2% decline below expected levels in the older and young adults, respectively. Conclusions: The differential age effect on sales may reflect concerns regarding health effects of cannabis vaping products and greater awareness of the outbreak among older adults. Findings highlight the importance of informing consumers about health risks associated with using cannabis vape products acquired from regulated versus illicit sources.",ENDS;cannabis vape;lung injuries (EVALI);sales;time series analysis,trauma
MicroRNA-200 Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles Promote Intestinal Epithelium Regeneration in Canonical MicroRNA-Deficient Mice.,"Intestinal epithelium undergoes regeneration after injuries, and the disruption of this process can lead to inflammatory bowel disease and tumorigenesis. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) residing in the crypts are crucial for maintaining the intestinal epithelium's homeostasis and promoting regeneration upon injury. However, the precise role of DGCR8, a critical component in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, in intestinal regeneration remains poorly understood. In this study, we provide compelling evidence demonstrating the indispensable role of epithelial miRNAs in the regeneration of the intestine in mice subjected to 5-FU or irradiation-induced injury. Through a comprehensive pooled screen of miRNA function in Dgcr8-deficient organoids, we observe that the loss of the miR-200 family leads to the hyperactivation of the p53 pathway, thereby reducing ISCs and impairing epithelial regeneration. Notably, downregulation of the miR-200 family and hyperactivation of the p53 pathway are verified in colonic tissues from patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC). Most importantly, the transient supply of miR-200 through the oral delivery of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying miR-200 restores ISCs and promotes intestinal regeneration in mice following acute injury. Our study implies the miR-200/p53 pathway as a promising therapeutic target for active UC patients with diminished levels of the miR-200 family. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the clinical application of LNP-miRNAs could enhance the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of existing therapeutic modalities for intestinal diseases.",intestinal regeneration;intestinal stem cell;lipid nanoparticle;microRNA;oral delivery,trauma

Children's right to play in times of war.,"This paper discusses children's right to play and its bioethical importance for children affected by war. Against the background of the current military conflicts, it analyses physical, psychological, and institutional factors that limit children's right to play in a situation involving armed conflict. Considering that the lack of institutional support of play for children affected by war constitutes a failure to fulfil our societal and political obligation under Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, this paper analyses the understanding of play adopted in this legal instrument. In line with the distinctions made in the Convention, it discusses the importance of play for children's life and survival, for their health and well-being, as well as for the recovery of trauma experienced by children affected by armed conflict. It thereby aims to contribute to the recognition and protection of this right on the grounds of bioethics and healthcare.",child health;children's right to play;children's rights;play;posttraumatic play;war,trauma
Meniscal fibrocartilage regeneration inspired by meniscal maturational and regenerative process.,"Meniscus is a complex and crucial fibrocartilaginous tissue within the knee joint. Meniscal regeneration remains to be a scientific and translational challenge. We clarified that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) participated in meniscal maturation and regeneration using MSC-tracing transgenic mice model. Here, inspired by meniscal natural maturational and regenerative process, we developed an effective and translational strategy to facilitate meniscal regeneration by three-dimensionally printing biomimetic meniscal scaffold combining autologous synovium transplant, which contained abundant intrinsic MSCs. We verified that this facilitated anisotropic meniscus-like tissue regeneration and protected cartilage from degeneration in large animal model. Mechanistically, the biomechanics and matrix stiffness up-regulated Piezo1 expression, facilitating concerted activation of calcineurin and NFATc1, further activated YAP-pSmad2/3-SOX9 axis, and consequently facilitated fibrochondrogenesis of MSCs during meniscal regeneration. In addition, Piezo1 induced by biomechanics and matrix stiffness up-regulated collagen cross-link enzyme expression, which catalyzed collagen cross-link and thereby enhanced mechanical properties of regenerated tissue.","D000818:Animals;D051379:Mice;D000072600:Meniscus;D051445:Fibrocartilage;D059630:Mesenchymal Stem Cells;D003094:Collagen;D023421:Models, Animal;D008822:Mice, Transgenic;D007473:Ion Channels",trauma
Remnant tissue enhances early postoperative biomechanical strength and infiltration of Scleraxis-positive cells within the grafted tendon in a rat anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction model.,"When ruptured, ligaments and tendons have limited self-repair capacity and rarely heal spontaneously. In the knee, the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) often ruptures during sports activities, causing functional impairment and requiring surgery using tendon grafts. Patients with insufficient time to recover before resuming sports risk re-injury. To develop more effective treatment, it is necessary to define mechanisms underlying ligament repair. For this, animal models can be useful, but mice are too small to create an ACL reconstruction model. Thus, we developed a transgenic rat model using control elements of Scleraxis (Scx), a transcription factor essential for ligament and tendon development, to drive GFP expression in order to localize Scx-expressing cells. As anticipated, Tg rats exhibited Scx-GFP in ACL during developmental but not adult stages. Interestingly, when we transplanted the flexor digitorum longus (FDP) tendon derived from adult Scx-GFP+ rats into WT adults, Scx-GFP was not expressed in transplanted tendons. However, tendons transplanted from adult WT rats into Scx-GFP rats showed upregulated Scx expression in tendon, suggesting that Scx-GFP+ cells are mobilized from tissues outside the tendon. Importantly, at 4 weeks post-surgery, Scx-GFP-expressing cells were more frequent within the grafted tendon when an ACL remnant was preserved (P group) relative to when it was not (R group) (P vs R groups (both n = 5), p<0.05), and by 6 weeks, biomechanical strength of the transplanted tendon was significantly increased if the remnant was preserved (P vsR groups (both n = 14), p<0.05). Scx-GFP+ cells increased in remnant tissue after surgery, suggesting remnant tissue is a source of Scx+ cells in grafted tendons. We conclude that the novel Scx-GFP Tg rat is useful to monitor emergence of Scx-positive cells, which likely contribute to increased graft strength after ACL reconstruction.",D006801:Humans;D000328:Adult;D051381:Rats;D000818:Animals;D051379:Mice;D016118:Anterior Cruciate Ligament;D013710:Tendons;D000070598:Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries;D007719:Knee Joint;D059549:Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,trauma
Corneal epithelialinduced by combined small incision lenticule extraction and accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking for myopia.,"To evaluate the changes of the corneal epithelial thickness (ET) profile induced by combined small incision lenticule extraction and accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking (SMILE-xtra) for myopia compared with the standard small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). Nuri Eye Hospital, 61, Dunsan-ro, Seo-gu, Daejeon, 35233, Korea. Retrospective cross-sectional study. Thirty-one myopic eye undergoing SMILE-xtra and control group of 36 myopic eyes undergoing SMILE were retrospectively analyzed. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (CIRRUS™ HD-OCT 5000, ZEISS, Dublin, CA) was used to measure corneal ET of 17 zones within the central 7-mm zone at preoperative, postoperative 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Postoperative ET alterations were analyzed for correlation with treatment parameters. There was no difference in preoperative mean age, postoperative MRSE, visual acuity, and ablation depth between the two groups, and there was a significant difference in preoperative central corneal thickness. Both groups showed the greatest increase in corneal ET in the paracentral area on the inferotemporal area, respectively, for 6 months. The preoperative MRSE and the ablation depth showed significant correlation with the postoperative epithelial thickening in mid-peripheral sectors in both groups, and significant negative correlations in paracentral sectors only in SMILE-xtra group. It is significant as the first study to compare corneal epithelial remodeling between SMILE and SMILE with accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking. The SMILE-xtra with the relatively large corneal ablation did not show a significant difference in the pattern of corneal epithelial remodeling compared to the SMILE group.",D006801:Humans;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D003315:Cornea;D009216:Myopia;D000072836:Surgical Wound;D003094:Collagen,trauma
"Acute inhibition of acid sensing ion channel 1a after spinal cord injury selectively affects excitatory synaptic transmission, but not intrinsic membrane properties, in deep dorsal horn interneurons.","Following a spinal cord injury (SCI), secondary damage mechanisms are triggered that cause inflammation and cell death. A key component of this secondary damage is a reduction in local blood flow that initiates a well-characterised ischemic cascade. Downstream hypoxia and acidosis activate acid sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) to trigger cell death. We recently showed that administration of a potent venom-derived inhibitor of ASIC1a, Hi1a, leads to tissue sparing and improved functional recovery when delivered up to 8 h after ischemic stroke. Here, we use whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in a spinal cord slice preparation to assess the effect of acute ASIC1a inhibition, via a single dose of Hi1a, on intrinsic membrane properties and excitatory synaptic transmission long-term after a spinal cord hemisection injury. We focus on a population of interneurons (INs) in the deep dorsal horn (DDH) that play a key role in relaying sensory information to downstream motoneurons. DDH INs in mice treated with Hi1a 1 h after a spinal cord hemisection showed no change in active or passive intrinsic membrane properties measured 4 weeks after SCI. DDH INs, however, exhibit significant changes in the kinetics of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents after a single dose of Hi1a, when compared to naive animals (unlike SCI mice). Our data suggest that acute ASIC1a inhibition exerts selective effects on excitatory synaptic transmission in DDH INs after SCI via specific ligand-gated receptor channels, and has no effect on other voltage-activated channels long-term after SCI.",D051379:Mice;D000818:Animals;D062565:Acid Sensing Ion Channels;D066148:Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn;D009435:Synaptic Transmission;D007395:Interneurons;D013119:Spinal Cord Injuries;D013116:Spinal Cord;D020671:Posterior Horn Cells,trauma
Simultaneous Bilateral Quadriceps Tendon Rupture Secondary to Parathyroid Carcinoma: A Case Report.,"Simultaneous bilateral quadriceps tendon ruptures are a rare occurrence commonly associated with a traumatic event or systemic disease. A 31-year-old man presented with simultaneous bilateral quadriceps tendon ruptures with associated hyperparathyroidism secondary to parathyroid carcinoma. The injury occurred after the patient attempted to lift a small wooden log from the ground. We discussed the multidisciplinary management of this patient resulting in bilateral quadriceps tendon repairs, tumor resection, and oncological and endocrinological restoration. Clinical follow-up is reported at 15 years after surgery. Parathyroid carcinoma is an extremely rare cancer and rarely the cause of hyperparathyroidism. The systemic effects of the tumor eventually lead to the rupturing of both quadriceps tendons.

Association Between Whole Blood Transfusion and Mortality Among Injured Pediatric Patients.,"To assess the association between whole blood (WB) and mortality among injured children who received immediate blood transfusion. The use of WB for transfusion therapy in trauma has been revisited, and recent studies have reported an association between WB and improved survival among adults. However, evidence of a similar association lacks in children. We performed a retrospective cohort study from the ACS-TQIP between 2020 and 2021. Patients were aged ≤16 years and had immediate blood transfusion within 4 hours of hospital arrival. Survival at 24 hours and 30 days were compared after creating 1:1 propensity-score matched cohorts, matching for demographics, injury type, vital signs on admission, trauma severity scores, hemorrhage control procedures, hospital characteristics, and the need for massive transfusion. A total of 2,729 patients were eligible for analysis. The median age was 14 years (interquartile range: 8-16 y); 1,862 (68.2%) patients were male; and 1,207 (44.2%) patients were White. A total of 319 (11.7%) patients received WB. After a 1:1-ratio propensity score matching, 318 matched pairs were compared. WB transfusion was associated with improved survival at 24 hours, demonstrating a 42% lower risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.98; P=0.042) Similarly, the survival benefit associated with WB transfusion remained consistent at 30 days (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.90; P=0.011). The use of WB was associated with improved survival among injured pediatric patients requiring immediate transfusion.",,trauma
Speos: an ensemble graph representation learning framework to predict core gene candidates for complex diseases.,"Understanding phenotype-to-genotype relationships is a grand challenge of 21st century biology with translational implications. The recently proposed ""omnigenic"" model postulates that effects of genetic variation on traits are mediated by core-genes and -proteins whose activities mechanistically influence the phenotype, whereas peripheral genes encode a regulatory network that indirectly affects phenotypes via core gene products. Here, we develop a positive-unlabeled graph representation-learning ensemble-approach based on a nested cross-validation to predict core-like genes for diverse diseases using Mendelian disorder genes for training. Employing mouse knockout phenotypes for external validations, we demonstrate that core-like genes display several key properties of core genes: Mouse knockouts of genes corresponding to our most confident predictions give rise to relevant mouse phenotypes at rates on par with the Mendelian disorder genes, and all candidates exhibit core gene properties like transcriptional deregulation in disease and loss-of-function intolerance. Moreover, as predicted for core genes, our candidates are enriched for drug targets and druggable proteins. In contrast to Mendelian disorder genes the new core-like genes are enriched for druggable yet untargeted gene products, which are therefore attractive targets for drug development. Interpretation of the underlying deep learning model suggests plausible explanations for our core gene predictions in form of molecular mechanisms and physical interactions. Our results demonstrate the potential of graph representation learning for the interpretation of biological complexity and pave the way for studying core gene properties and future drug development.",D000818:Animals;D051379:Mice;D006259:Craniocerebral Trauma;D016503:Drug Delivery Systems;D000076722:Drug Development;D010641:Phenotype;D012313:RNA,trauma
The impact of placental genomic risk for schizophrenia and birth asphyxia on brain development.,"The placenta plays a role in fetal brain development, and pregnancy and birth complications can be signs of placental dysfunction. Birth asphyxia is associated with smaller head size and higher risk of developing schizophrenia (SZ), but whether birth asphyxia and placental genomic risk factors associated with SZ are related and how they might impact brain development is unclear. 433 adult patients with SZ and 870 healthy controls were clinically evaluated and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. Pregnancy and birth information were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) from the latest genome-wide association study in SZ were differentiated into placental PRS (PlacPRS) and non-placental PRS. If the interaction between PRSs and birth asphyxia on case-control status was significant, neonatal head circumference (nHC) and adult intracranial volume (ICV) were further evaluated with these variables using multiple regression. PlacPRS in individuals with a history of birth asphyxia was associated with a higher likelihood of being a patient with SZ (t = 2.10, p = 0.018). We found a significant interaction between PlacPRS and birth asphyxia on nHC in the whole sample (t = -2.43, p = 0.008), with higher placental PRS for SZ associated with lower nHC in those with birth asphyxia. This relationship was specific to males (t = -2.71, p = 0.005) and also found with their adult ICV (t = -1.97, p = 0.028). These findings suggest that placental pathophysiology and birth asphyxia may affect early and late trajectories of brain development, particularly in males with a higher vulnerability to SZ. This knowledge might lead to new strategies of treatment and prevention in SZ.","D011247:Pregnancy;D000328:Adult;D008297:Male;D007231:Infant, Newborn;D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D010920:Placenta;D001237:Asphyxia;D055106:Genome-Wide Association Study;D012559:Schizophrenia;D023281:Genomics;D001921:Brain",trauma
Hyperoxia can Induce Lung Injury by Upregulating AECII Autophagy and Apoptosis Via the mTOR Pathway.,"Oxygen therapy is a crucial medical intervention, but it is undeniable that it can lead to lung damage. The mTOR pathway plays a pivotal role in governing cell survival, including autophagy and apoptosis, two phenomena deeply entwined with the evolution of diseases. However, it is unclarified whether the mTOR pathway is involved in hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI). The current study aims to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HALI by constructing in vitro and in vivo models using H2O2 and hyperoxia exposure, respectively. To investigate the role of mTOR, the experiment was divided into five groups, including normal group, injury group, mTOR inhibitor group, mTOR activator group, and DMSO control group. Western blotting, Autophagy double labeling, TUNEL staining, and HE staining were applied to evaluate protein expression, autophagy activity, cell apoptosis, and pathological changes in lung tissues. Our data revealed that hyperoxia can induce autophagy and apoptosis in Type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII) isolated from the treated rats, as well as injuries in the rat lung tissues; also, H2O2 stimulation increased autophagy and apoptosis in MLE-12 cells. Noticeably, the experiments performed in both in vitro and in vivo models proved that the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin (Rapa) functioned synergistically with hyperoxia or H2O2 to promote AECII autophagy, which led to increased apoptosis and exacerbated lung injury. On the contrary, activation of mTOR with MHY1485 suppressed autophagy activity, consequently resulting in reduced apoptosis and lung injury in H2O2-challenged MLE-12 cells and hyperoxia-exposed rats. In conclusion, hyperoxia caused lung injury via mTOR-mediated AECII autophagy.",Apoptosis;Autophagy;Hyperoxic acute lung injury;Type II alveolar epithelial cells;mTOR,trauma

Our secondary objectives assessed the effects of pre-hospital trauma team activation on time to emergency procedure, computed tomography, blood transfusion, and critical administration threshold, as well as emergency department length of stay. We conducted a 40-month health records review on all trauma team activations at The Ottawa Hospital, a Level 1 Trauma Center. Outcomes were compared between pre-hospital and in-hospital trauma team activations. We used logistic and linear regression models to assess outcomes, while controlling for injury severity score, age, systolic blood pressure, and anti-coagulation use. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A sensitivity analysis was also used to validate the primary outcome results. Of the 1013 trauma team activations occurring during the study period, 762 patients were included. The mean age (41.3 vs. 43.8) and percentage of males (79.4% vs. 77.5%) for pre-hospital activations were similar to their counterparts. Pre-hospital activations did not have a statistically significant effect on 24-h mortality (14.4% vs. 4.5%; P = 0.30). However, pre-hospital activations did demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in time (minutes) to emergency procedure (18.0 vs. 27.0; P < 0.001), computed tomography (37.0 vs 42.0; P = 0.009), and blood transfusion (14.0 vs. 28.0; P < 0.001), as well as emergency department length of stay (101.0 vs. 171.0; P < 0.001). When controlling for key covariates, pre-hospital trauma team activation did not have a significant effect on 24-h mortality, but did result in a significant reduction in time to emergency procedure, computed tomography, and blood transfusion, as well as emergency department length of stay. Our study demonstrates that pre-hospital trauma team activation can expedite patient intervention and disposition.",Mortality;Pre-hospital;Trauma;Trauma team activation,trauma
"Adult Mental Health Presentations to Emergency Departments in Victoria, Australia between January 2018 and October 2020: Changes Associated with COVID-19 Pandemic Public Health Restrictions.","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures altered patterns of help-seeking for mental health, with increases in emergency department utilisation reported. We examined the association between COVID-19 restrictions and adult emergency department (ED) mental health presentations in Victoria, Australia, through secondary analysis of data from 39 public EDs across the state. Participants were all patients (18+ years) presenting between 1 January 2018 and 31 October 2020 with mental health or intentional self-harm. The main outcome was number of presentations for each mental health condition, by patient age, socioeconomic status (SES), location, and ED triage category. We used a Poisson regression model to compare predicted monthly ED presentations based on trends from 2018, 2019 and 2020 (up to 31 March), with observed presentations during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 April to 31 October 2020). There was an average of 4,967 adult mental health presentations per month pre-COVID-19 (1 January-31 March 2020) and 5,054 per month during the COVID-19 period (1 April-31 October 2020). Compared to predicted incidence, eating disorder presentations increased 24.0% in the COVID-19 period, primarily among higher SES females aged 18-24 years. Developmental/behavioural disorder presentations decreased by 19.7% for all age groups. Pandemic restrictions were associated with overall increases in monthly adult ED presentations for mental health, with some disorders increasing and others decreasing. Accessibility of acute mental health services needs to be addressed to meet changing demand and ensure services are responsive to changes in presentations resulting from future public health challenges.",Adult;Australia;COVID-19;Emergency department;Lockdown;Mental health;Victoria,trauma
Posttraumatic Growth in U.S. Military Veterans: Results from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study.,"Despite increasing recognition that positive psychological changes or posttraumatic growth (PTG) may develop after highly stressful or traumatic events, contemporary population-based data on the epidemiology of PTG in high-risk samples such as U.S. military veterans are lacking. Additionally, in light of emerging evidence suggesting an 8-factor model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, an up-to-date characterization of how these symptom clusters relate to PTG can help inform efforts to help promote PTG. Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS), which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 3,847 trauma-exposed U.S. veterans. Participants completed assessments of potentially traumatic events, PTSD symptoms, and PTG, as well as a broad range of sociodemographic, military, trauma, health, personality, and psychosocial characteristics. Results revealed that 63.2% of trauma-exposed veterans and 86.4% of veterans who screened positive for PTSD endorsed moderate-or-greater PTG; these prevalences are higher than those reported in an independent U.S. veteran sample in 2011 (50.1% and 72.0%, respectively). An inverted U-shaped association was observed between PTSD symptom severity and PTG levels, with scores of 31 to 51 on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 associated with the highest likelihood of PTG. Intrinsic religiosity and internally- and externally-generated intrusive symptoms of PTSD were identified as the strongest correlates of PTG. Results suggest that prevention and treatment efforts to mitigate severe PTSD symptoms, and help promote intrinsic religiosity, and more deliberate and organized rumination about traumatic experiences may help foster PTG in veterans.",Intrusions;Posttraumatic Stress Disorder;Psychological Growth;Spirituality,trauma
Comparative Study of the Long-Term Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Nutritional Practices Among International Elite and Sub-Elite Athletes: A Sample of 1420 Participants from 14 Countries.,"Although several studies have shown that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown has had negative impacts on mental health and eating behaviors among the general population and athletes, few studies have examined the long-term effects on elite and sub-elite athletes. The present study aimed to investigate the long-term impact of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health and eating behaviors in elite versus sub-elite athletes two years into the pandemic. A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted between March and April 2022, involving athletes from 14 countries, using a convenient non-probabilistic and snowball sampling method. A total of 1420 athletes (24.5 ± 7.9 years old, 569 elites, 35% women, and 851 sub-elites, 45% women) completed an online survey-based questionnaire. The questionnaire included a sociodemographic survey, information about the COVID-19 pandemic, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) for mental health assessment, and the Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants (REAP-S) for assessing eating behavior. The results showed that compared to sub-elite athletes, elite athletes had lower scores on the DASS-21 (p = .001) and its subscales of depression (p = .003), anxiety (p = .007), and stress (p < .001), as well as a lower REAP-S score indicating lower diet quality (p = .013). In conclusion, two years into the pandemic, elite athletes were likelier to have better mental health profiles than sub-elite athletes but surprisingly had lower diet quality.",Athlete;Health;Infectious disease;Nutrition;Performance,trauma
A novel degradable PCL/PLLA strapping band for internal fixation of fracture.,"Early fracture fixation is the critical factor in fracture healing. Common internal fracture implants are made of metallic materials, which often affects the imaging quality of CT and MRI. Most patients will choose secondary surgery to remove the internal fixation implants, which causes secondary damage to them. The development of new degradable internal fracture implants has attracted more and more attention from orthopedic surgeons and researchers. Based on these problems, we improved the various properties of medical grade polycaprolactone (PCL) by adding poly(L-lactide) (PLLA). We produced PCL/PLLA strapping bands with different mass ratios by injection molding. We compared the mechanical properties, degradation properties, cell biocompatibility, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) adhesion, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and fracture fixation effect of these strapping bands. The results showed that the tensile strength and yield force of the strapping bands increased with the increase of the content of PLLA. The addition of PLLA could significantly improve the mechanical strength in the early stage and accelerate the degradation rate of the strapping band. PCL/PLLA (80/20) strapping band had no significant cytotoxicity toward rBMSCs and could promote osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. The strapping band could ensure femoral fracture healing of beagles in 3 months and didn't cause damage to the surrounding tissues and main organs. This study will provide some new insights into the biodegradable products of PCL/PLLA blends for internal fixation of fracture. We produced novel degradable PCL/PLLA strapping bands with different mass ratios by injection molding. We tested the biological safety of the prepared internal fixation strapping bands for fracture, such as cell experiment in vitro and animal experiment, and studied the degradation behavior in vitro. The strapping bands could ensure femoral fracture healing of beagles. This study will provide some new insights into the biodegradable products of PCL/PLLA blends for internal fixation of fracture.

Exploring Canadian Career Firefighters' Understanding of the Return-to-Work Process After Musculoskeletal Injuries.,"Firefighters perform dangerous and physically demanding work, increasing their risk of musculoskeletal injuries that can lead to work absences. Return-to-work procedures can help firefighters return-to-work sooner and safely. The purpose of this study was to explore what firefighters understand about return-to-work procedures in their workplaces, and what firefighters believe the facilitators and barriers to return-to-work are. Thirty-eight Canadian career firefighters were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Qualitative descriptive methods were used to analyze the transcripts. Two researchers performed the inductive coding and thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: 1. Variation in the return-to-work process knowledge among firefighters based on their experiences; 2. Accessible medical resources and treatments to support injury recovery; 3. Light duties must be meaningful and suitable; 4. Pressures to return-to-work too soon may lead to negative consequences; and 5. Heavy physical demands of firefighting may become a barrier for return-to-work. 'Factors affecting RTW depended on personal experiences and context' was the overarching theme identified, as many reported facilitators for return-to-work were also reported as barriers in different contexts. There was a variation in the experiences and understanding of return-to-work. There is a lack of knowledge of the return-to-work processes. Firefighters require access to clear return-to-work policies and procedures and treatments that are targeted to firefighting duties to support recovery from injuries and regain physical abilities after an injury. Firefighters must be able to perform all essential duties before returning to firefighting work, as returning to work too soon can lead to further injury.",Firefighters;Injury;Musculoskeletal disorders;Qualitative description;Return-to-work,trauma
Continuous chest compressions are associated with higher peak inspiratory pressures when compared to 30:2 in an experimental cardiac arrest model.,"Ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has long been a part of the standard treatment during cardiac arrests. Ventilation is usually given either during continuous chest compressions (CCC) or during a short pause after every 30 chest compressions (30:2). There is limited knowledge of how ventilation is delivered if it effects the hemodynamics and if it plays a role in the occurrence of lung injuries. The aim of this study was to compare ventilation parameters, hemodynamics, blood gases and lung injuries during experimental CPR given with CCC and 30:2 in a porcine model. Sixteen pigs weighing approximately 33 kg were randomized to either receive CPR with CCC or 30:2. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by passing an electrical current through the heart. CPR was started after 3 min and given for 20 min. Chest compressions were provided mechanically with a chest compression device and ventilations were delivered manually with a self-inflating bag and 12 l/min of oxygen. During the experiment, ventilation parameters and hemodynamics were sampled continuously, and arterial blood gases were taken every five minutes. After euthanasia and cessation of CPR, the lungs and heart were removed in block and visually examined followed by sampling of lung tissue which were examined using microscopy. In the CCC group and the 30:2 group, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was 58.6 and 35.1 cmH2O (p < 0.001), minute volume (MV) 2189.6 and 1267.1 ml (p < 0.001), peak expired carbon dioxide (PECO2) 28.6 and 39.4 mmHg (p = 0.020), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 50.2 and 61.1 mmHg (p = 0.013) and pH 7.3 and 7.2 (p = 0.029), respectively. Central venous pressure (CVP) decreased more over time in the 30:2 group (p = 0.023). All lungs were injured, but there were no differences between the groups. Ventilation during CCC resulted in a higher PIP, MV and pH and lower PECO2 and PaCO2, showing that ventilation mode during CPR can affect ventilation parameters and blood gases.",Animal model;Cardiac arrest;Cardiopulmonary resuscitation;Lung injuries;Ventilation,trauma
3D C-arm navigated acromioclavicular joint stabilization.,"Surgical treatment options for acromioclavicular joint separations are varied. Frequently, suspension devices (SD) are inserted for stabilization under arthroscopic view. This study investigates the feasibility and accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) digital-volume-tomography (DVT) C-arm navigated implantation with regard to the general trend toward increasingly minimally invasive procedures. The implantation of a TightRope® suture button system (SD) via a navigated vertical drill channel through the clavicle and coracoid was investigated in 10 synthetic shoulder models with a mobile isocentric C-arm image intensifier setup in the usual parasagittal position. Thereby, in addition the placement of an additive horizontal suture cerclage via a navigated drill channel through the acromion was assessed. All vertical drill channels in the Coracoclavicular (CC) direction could be placed in a line centrally through the clavicle and the coracoid base. The horizontal drill channels in the Acromioclavicular (AC) direction ran strictly in the acromion, without affecting the AC joint or lateral clavicle. All SD could be well inserted and anchored. After tensioning and knotting of the system, the application of the horizontal AC cerclage was easily possible. The image quality was good and all relevant structures could be assessed well. Intraoperative 3D DVT imaging of the shoulder joint using a mobile isocentric C-arm in the usual parasagittal position to the patient is possible. Likewise, DVT navigated SD implantation at the AC joint in CC and AC direction on a synthetic shoulder model. By combining both methods, the application in vivo could be possible. Further clinical studies on feasibility and comparison with established methods should be performed.",3D C-arm navigation;AC joint separation;Rockwood;Shoulder imaging;Tightrope;Tossy,trauma
Long-term spaceflight composite stress induces depression and cognitive impairment in astronauts-insights from neuroplasticity.,"The environment on the space station is quite unique compared to Earth, which is a composite of multiple stressors, such as microgravity, isolation, confinement, noise, circadian rhythm disturbance, and so on. During prolonged space missions, astronauts have to stay in such extreme environments for long periods, which could induce adverse effects on both their physical and mental health. In some circumstances, this kind of long-term spaceflight composite stress (LSCS) could also induce depression and cognitive impairment in various ways, including dysregulating the neuroplasticity of the brains of astronauts, which should be attached to great importance. Here, we have comprehensively reviewed the impact of individual and combined stressors on depression and cognitive function during long-term spaceflight, explained the underlying mechanisms of those effects from the perspective of neuroplasticity, and current countermeasures for mitigating these challenges. This review provides insights into LSCS and potential neuroplasticity mechanisms, current with potentially great impact for understanding and mitigating the mental health risks and traumas of career astronauts and space tourists.",D006801:Humans;D018480:Astronauts;D003863:Depression;D013026:Space Flight;D060825:Cognitive Dysfunction;D009473:Neuronal Plasticity,trauma
Emphatic information on bone mineral loss using quantitative ultrasound sonometer for expeditious prediction of osteoporosis.,"Osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA) are skeletal disorders characterized by a reduction in bone density and quality, resulting in increased fragility and susceptibility to fractures. These illnesses are exhibiting a higher prevalence among both males and females. Fracture risk is determined by using the BMD score (Bone Mineral Density). Looking at the bone loss that comes with osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP), this study also looks at the technological methods used to test for these conditions in order to improve therapies and treatment plans for older people. As a matter of consideration, the prevalence of osteoporosis is higher among postmenopausal women (20%) compared to premenopausal women (14.28%) and males (6.77%). The utilization of a preliminary calcaneal Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) examination is warranted in order to effectively handle the matter of osteoporosis. The prompt assessment of a patient can provide valuable insights into potential fractures and aid in the prevention of bone injury. In a nutshell, it is imperative to comprehend the impact of OA (osteoarthritis) and OP (osteoporosis) on bone health in order to effectively manage the escalating apprehensions surrounding these conditions. Sophisticated diagnostic techniques, such as the calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) test, have the potential to enhance the well-being of older individuals by enabling early detection and treatment of many ailments.","D008297:Male;D005260:Female;D006801:Humans;D000368:Aged;D010024:Osteoporosis;D001851:Bone Diseases, Metabolic;D015519:Bone Density;D050723:Fractures, Bone;D008903:Minerals;D010003:Osteoarthritis",trauma

Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus: Evaluation of Risk Factors and Their Impact on Postoperative Outcomes.,"Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT), also known as talar osteochondritis dissecans, is minor fracture to the articular cartilage of the talas subchondral bone it is associated with. The literature regarding its impact on patient demographics on post-operative associations of OLT-related repairs is lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was retrospectively reviewed, collecting data on patients with an OLT procedure between the 2008 through 2016. Univariate analysis was utilized to compare patient demographics, potential risk factors, comorbidities, hospital, and operative variables. Finally, Logistic regressions were utilized, adjusting associations of its risk factors and respective associations in a postoperative manner. A total of 491 patients with an OLT were collected for analysis. Hypertension requiring medication was a risk factor for readmission (P = 0.039) and longer lengths of stay (P = 0.021). The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification significantly predicted increased rates of longer lengths of stay, with ASA class III being more likely than ASA class I (odds ratio [OR]: 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.7-14.2]; P = 0.004) or ASA class II (OR: 3.0; 95% CI [1.2-7.4]; P = 0.016) for patients to remain in hospital for longer than one day. Furthermore, patients who underwent an OLT with ASA class III underwent greater than average lengths of stay than ASA class I patients (0.54 ± 0.9 vs. 0.14 ± 0.5 days, respectively; P = 0.011). Hypertension requiring medication and ASA classification predicted, in a positive manner, postoperative complications occurring in patients with an OLT. Despite being related with extended lengths of stay, only hypertension requiring medication were associated with increased rates of readmission. Orthopaedic surgeons may use these findings to counsel patients on their risk factors and subsequently prepare themselves for peri- and post-operative complications.","D006801:Humans;D013628:Talus;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D050723:Fractures, Bone;D011183:Postoperative Complications;D012307:Risk Factors;D006973:Hypertension",trauma
Hip Fractures in Patients with Dementia: An Emerging Orthopedic Concern.,"Hip fractures are a very common injury in the elderly population associated with an increased mortality rate. Currently, more and more elderly patients are diagnosed with dementia. Demented patients are more prone to falls and hip fractures compared to the general population because of conditions related to their disease such as instability, osteoporosis, poor muscle control and weakness. The coexistence of dementia and hip fractures is a difficult situation for both the patients and the treating physicians because of postoperative complications in this frail subgroup of patients and their inability to stand up and walk. To enhance the literature, we reviewed published studies of hip fracture patients suffering from dementia to discuss why they have more frequent hip fractures, to review their associated in-hospital complications, and to emphasize on their postoperative management to be able to reach the pre-injury activity level and optimal quality of life.",D006801:Humans;D000368:Aged;D011788:Quality of Life;D006620:Hip Fractures;D009985:Orthopedics;D010024:Osteoporosis;D003704:Dementia,trauma
Circular External Fixation of Ankle and Pilon Fractures Using Novel Polyaxial Locking Struts.,Ankle fractures and pilon fractures are common injuries and can range in severity from low-energy rotational injuries to high-energy fractures of the articular surface. External fixation can be used in a staged treatment strategy to allow for a closed reduction and soft tissue rest before definitive internal fixation or as a definitive treatment method. We describe a technique that involves the use of novel polyaxial locking struts in conjunction with circular external fixation that can be used as a temporary form of external fixation or as definitive treatment of high-energy ankle and pilon fractures.,D006801:Humans;D000842:Ankle;D064386:Ankle Fractures;D016267:External Fixators;D005592:Fracture Fixation;D013978:Tibial Fractures,trauma
Ipsilateral Hip and Knee Reconstruction Using an Intramedullary Total Femoral Replacement System.,"The intramedullary total femoral reconstruction (ITFR) was used successfully in a 62-year-old patient with myxoid liposarcoma of the thigh and post-radiation fracture nonunion of the proximal femur and osteonecrosis of the ipsilateral knee. This described technique offers the advantage of a less invasive prosthesis insertion, preservation of the surrounding muscle attachments, better functional outcomes, and lower complication rates.

The Need for Persistence in the Diagnosis of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Mono-arthritis: A Unique Case Presentation.,"Although tuberculosis (TB) is considered to be a common disease confined to undeveloped or developing countries, it may also appear in countries that accept great migrant influx from endemic areas. In terms of the skeletal system, it can be involved in 1-6% of tuberculosis patients while the knee joint is the third most frequently affected site after spine and hip. Given that systemic symptoms are present in only one-third of patients with skeletal tuberculosis and secondary septic arthritis, TB is often indolent and diagnosis can hence be missed or delayed. As a result, a high index of suspicion is imperative. Here, we aim to report a case of mono-arthritis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a native 77-year-old man who was suffering from low-grade knee pain for six months and despite multiple presentations to the Accident and Emergency department, diagnosis had not been established.","D008297:Male;D006801:Humans;D000368:Aged;D009169:Mycobacterium tuberculosis;D010003:Osteoarthritis;D013131:Spine;D004636:Emergency Service, Hospital;D014376:Tuberculosis",trauma
"Road Accidents, Polytrauma Patients, and Their Economic Burden.","Trauma is a problem of global public health with economic, social and political extensions. It is constantly growing due to road accidents. The cost of hospitalization and the loss of working hours for those who managed to reach the hospital are huge for the national economy of each country.

A total of 68 injured people were the study sample during the period 2014-2017. The study was conducted in a University hospital in Athens (Greece). The mean age of the patients was 36.67 years. The mortality was 13.2% and the mean cost of every polytrauma patient was 14.272 Euros. Nearly half of them had an infection, which increased the cost.

Sucralfate Prevents Pin Site Infections of External Fixators in Open Tibia Fractures.,"Pin site infections are the main complication of external fixators. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of pin site infections ranges from 2% to 30%. Until now, no satisfactory prevention strategy exists. Therefore, we performed this study to assess the effect of a sucralfate gel 25% applied around the pins of external fixation systems in trauma patients with open tibia fractures. We prospectively studied two groups of patients with open tibia fractures treated with external fixators. In group A patients, pin site care was performed with the use of normal saline and plain dressings once a day. In group B patients, pin site care was performed with the use of sucralfate gel 25%. The incidence of pin site infections was 33.33% for patients of group A and 16.67% for patients of group B. Patients of group B showed significantly lower rate of pin site infections compared to patients of group A (p-value = 0.032). No patient experienced any complications related to the local application of the drug. Sucralfate significantly prevents pin site infections of external fixators in open tibia fractures. Therefore, it can be used as a preventive antimicrobial agent for pin site infections in patients with external fixators.",D006801:Humans;D013392:Sucralfate;D013977:Tibia;D016267:External Fixators;D001858:Bone Nails;D013203:Staphylococcal Infections;D013978:Tibial Fractures,trauma
Differences in Cortical Activation During Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion in Chronic Ankle Instability: A Task-fMRI Study.,"Chronic ankle instability is a common sports injury that often presents with increased plantarflexion and restricted dorsiflexion. The cumulative effect of peripheral injuries may induce neuroplasticity in the central nervous system. However, the relationship between dorsiflexion or plantarflexion and the central nervous system in patients with chronic ankle instability remains unknown. (1) Is there a difference in region and voxel (volume pixel) of cortical activation during plantarflexion and dorsiflexion between patients with chronic ankle instability and a control group with normal ankle function? (2) Is there a correlation between activation of sensorimotor-related brain regions and three clinical measurement scales of ankle function and disease severity in patients with chronic ankle instability? Between December 2020 and May 2022, we treated 400 patients who had chronic ankle instability. Ten percent (40 patients; mean ± standard deviation age 29 ± 7 years; 17 male patients) were randomly selected to participate in this study. We recruited 42 volunteers with normal ankle function (mean age 28 ± 5 years; 21 male participants) matched by age and education level. A total of 2.5% (1 of 40) of patients with bilateral chronic ankle instability and 30% (12 of 40) with left-sided chronic ankle injury did not meet our inclusion criteria and were excluded from the study. The control group underwent MRI with good image quality. Finally, 27 patients with chronic ankle instability (mean age 26 ± 5 years; 10 male patients) and 42 participants with normal ankle function were enrolled. Ankle function and disease severity were assessed using three clinical scales: the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool, Karlsson-Peterson Ankle Function Score, and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score. A uniplanar and nonweightbearing ankle dorsiflexion-plantarflexion paradigm (a recognized model or pattern) was performed using a short-block design during the functional MRI scan. This experimental design included a series of on-off periods consisting of movement and a rest period. From 15° of plantarflexion to 15° of dorsiflexion, the manipulator allowed 30° of ankle rotation. The cerebral excitability patterns between patients with chronic ankle instability and controls were analyzed using t-tests. We retained voxels with p values less than 0.05 in a voxel-level family-wise error correction. Clusters with voxel numbers greater than 10 were retained. The Cohen d coefficient was used to calculate between-group effect sizes. Spearman analysis was performed to explore the correlation between activation regions and the three clinical assessment scales. In the patient group, cortical activation was greater during plantarflexion than during dorsiflexion, which was different from that in the control group. The between-group comparison showed that patients with chronic ankle instability had reduced activation in the ipsilateral precuneus (cluster size = 35 voxels [95% CI -0.23 to 0.07]; p < 0.001) during dorsiflexion, whereas during plantarflexion, chronic ankle instability caused increased activation in the ipsilateral superior temporal gyrus (cluster size = 90 voxels [95% CI -0.73 to -0.13]; p < 0.001), precuneus (cluster size = 18 voxels [95% CI -0.56 to -0.19]; p < 0.001), supplementary motor area (cluster size = 57 voxels [95% CI -0.31 to 0.00]; p < 0.001), superior frontal gyrus (cluster size = 43 voxels [95% CI -0.82 to -0.29]; p < 0.001), medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (cluster size = 39 voxels [95% CI 0.41 to 0.78]; p < 0.001), and contralateral postcentral gyrus (cluster size = 100 voxels [95% CI -0.32 to 0.02]; p < 0.001). Patients with chronic ankle instability showed a large effect size compared with controls (Cohen d > 0.8). During plantarflexion, the number of activated voxels in the supplementary motor area had a modest, positive correlation with the Karlsson-Peterson Ankle Function Score (r = 0.52; p = 0.01), and the number of activated voxels in the primary motor cortex (M1) and primary sensory cortex (S1) had a weak, positive correlation with the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score in patients with chronic ankle instability (M1: r = 0.45; p = 0.02, S1: r = 0.49; p = 0.01). Compared with volunteers with normal ankle function, patients with chronic ankle instability had increased cortical activation during plantarflexion and decreased cortical activation during dorsiflexion. We analyzed the central neural mechanisms of chronic ankle instability in patients with sports injuries and provided a theoretical basis for the development of new central and peripheral interventions in the future. Because there was a positive correlation between the neural activity in sensorimotor-related regions during plantarflexion and clinical severity, clinicians might one day be able to help patients who have chronic ankle instability with neuromuscular rehabilitation by applying electrical stimulation to specific targets (such as S1M1 and the supplementary motor area) or by increasing activation of sensorimotor neurons through ankle movement.",,trauma
Worker and Work-Related Factors Influence on Musculoskeletal Symptoms among Veterinary Surgeons.,"Worker and work-related musculoskeletal symptoms are prevalent among surgeons operating on human patients. Despite incidence rates for accidents among veterinarians and their staff being 2.9 times higher than that of general practitioners of human medicine, little is known about musculoskeletal symptoms among veterinary surgeons. In this study, 212 board-certified members of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons responded to a survey regarding various work-related activities and their experience with musculoskeletal symptoms in 10 different body regions. Across all body regions, reported pain increased from before to after a typical day of surgery(p<.01). Gender, weight, age, and years performing surgery were worker factors that were related to pain(p<.05), while number of procedures, practice focus, and proportion of minimally invasive surgery were work factors related to pain(p<.05). Our findings suggest that musculoskeletal symptoms are prevalent among veterinary surgeons and may help provide evidence for guidelines for minimizing musculoskeletal injuries in veterinary surgery.",Musculoskeletal disorders;Veterinary surgery;Work-related risk factors;Workplace ergonomics,trauma
Pott Puffy Tumor Secondary to Cranial Vault Reconstruction in a Patient With Metopic Craniosynostosis.,"Pott puffy tumor (PPT) is defined as a subperiosteal abscess of the anterior wall of the frontal sinus associated with underlying frontal osteomyelitis. PPT affects all age groups but occurs predominantly in adolescents. The potential etiologies include rhinosinusitis, a history of direct trauma to the forehead, odontogenic disease, intranasal drug abuse, diabetes, or other immunocompromised states. We introduce a case of a 6-year-old boy with a medical history of anterior cranial vault remodeling presenting with localized forehead swelling. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated mucosal thickening and a region of dehiscence in the wall of the frontal sinus; the presence of midline subperiosteal abscess was consistent with a diagnosis of PPT. Due to concerns for intracranial involvement, we utilized removal and replacement of the anterior wall of the frontal sinus, complete removal of sinus mucosa, and frontal sinus obliteration with bilateral peri-cranial flaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case description of a PPT secondary to cranial vault reconstruction in a patient with metopic craniosynostosis.",,trauma

[Classification of lower impacted third molars position and their interrelationship with mandibular canal].,"Classification of lower Impacted third molars position and their interrelationship with mandibular canal have a great scientific, theoretical and practical importance. An attempt to systematize and classify all anatomical impacted third molars position has been made by many authors. Based on our scientific literature search, we found: 8 impacted third molars classifications, 7 third molars and mandibular canal interposition classifications, as well as 5 classifications of mandibular canal anatomical branching variants. Most classifications are proposed by the author to predict third molar eruption perspective, determine level of operation complexity and prevent mandibular canal damage. New clinical classification development of impacted third molars interrelationship with mandibular canal, which combined the radiological PR, CBCT criteria, neurovascular bundle trauma prognosis, and operative technic choice can be actual.","D006801:Humans;D008964:Molar, Third;D000088263:Mandibular Canal;D008334:Mandible;D011862:Radiography, Panoramic;D014095:Tooth, Impacted;D014081:Tooth Extraction;D008340:Mandibular Nerve",trauma
Nasal high frequency oscillatory highflow therapy in preterm infants: A randomized crossover trial.,"To assess the clinical efficacy, safety, and potential physiological mechanisms of highflow therapy with superimposed high frequency oscillations (""osciflow""). In this prospective, randomized, single center crossover trial, 30 preterm infants were randomized to receive osciflow or highflow therapy first, each for 180 min. During osciflow, an oscillatory amplitude of 20 mbar and a frequency of 6 Hz were set. The flow rate was 4 L/min during both interventions. Primary outcome was the paired difference in the combined number of desaturations (SpO2  < 80%) and bradycardia (heart rate <80 beats per min) between interventions. Safety outcomes included nasal trauma, pneumothorax and treatment failure, and a pain score was assessed. In 20 infants, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) recordings were performed to evaluate oscillatory (VOsc ) and tidal volumes (VT ) at the lung level. Infants with a mean (SD) postnatal age of 33.1 ± 1.2 weeks were included. The median (IQR) number of episodes of desaturation and bradycardia was 19.5 (6-49) during osciflow and 26 (6-44) during highflow therapy (paired difference -2; IQR -10 to 9; p = .37). There were no differences in safety outcomes and pain scores. During osciflow, EIT recordings showed a signal at 6 Hz, which was not detectable during highflow. Corresponding mean (SD) VOsc /VT ratio was 9% (±5%). In preterm infants, osciflow did not reduce the number of desaturations and bradycardia compared with highflow therapy. Although VOsc were transmitted to the lung during osciflow, their magnitude was small. Osciflow was safe and well tolerated.",apnea of prematurity;bradycardia;desaturations;electrical impedance tomography;noninvasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation,trauma
Escaping the Silos: Utilization of a Pediatric Trauma Escape Room to Promote Interprofessional Education and Collaboration.,"Millions of children are treated annually for trauma-related injuries but comprise a smaller proportion of emergency department visits than adults. As a result, emergency department teams may not have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to care for pediatric patients, and specialty teams may not interact enough as an interprofessional team to provide high-quality patient care. The purpose of this project is to describe a novel interprofessional simulation-based education initiative to assist pediatric trauma team readiness. An escape room was designed to provide an interactive educational environment focused on pediatric trauma education. Using an interprofessional dyad of a trauma nursing specialist and a pediatric nursing expert, the escape room was designed as a series of clues to improve pediatric skills and interprofessional collaboration between specialty teams. The escape room training was conducted (from February to March, 2023) in a large Southeastern U.S. Level II adult trauma center. Twenty-one registered nurses from different specialty teams participated in the simulation exercises with overwhelmingly positive feedback. Colleagues reported this was a unique way to deliver education that resulted in innovative team building and enriched collegiality between the specialty teams. The escape room educational format was positively received, and future events are planned across disciplines and various topics. Trauma centers with lower pediatric volumes seeking to provide engaging team-based education may use this format as a unique and innovative way to develop teams for clinical success.","D006801:Humans;D002648:Child;D000081784:Interprofessional Education;D002983:Clinical Competence;D004636:Emergency Service, Hospital;D014193:Trauma Centers;D010371:Pediatric Nursing;D007400:Interprofessional Relations;D010348:Patient Care Team",trauma
A Fast-Track Respiratory Protocol for High Cervical Spine Injury: A Case Report.,"Cervical spinal cord injury can greatly affect pulmonary function, resulting in complications, including respiratory failure with prolonged mechanical ventilation, ultimately leading to increased mortality and high health care costs. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is particularly challenging in patients with complete high spinal cord injury. We present the case of a 42-year-old man who suffered a complete cervical 5-6 spinal cord injury following a rollover motor vehicle crash and subsequently developed postoperative pneumonia and severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. He received a novel approach to fast-track respiratory care, including early and aggressive secretion clearance management, moderate pressure level of airway pressure release ventilation, timely transition to spontaneous mode, early tracheostomy and humane care, and high-flow oxygenation via tracheotomy after weaning off the ventilator. As a result, the patient experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function and was successfully liberated from the ventilator within a 2-week period. This case highlights the potential effectiveness of fast-track respiratory care in promoting lung function restoration and expediting liberation from mechanical ventilation in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure following a complete cervical spinal cord injury. However, further research is warranted to validate these findings and expand our understanding in this area.","D000328:Adult;D006801:Humans;D008297:Male;D002574:Cervical Vertebrae;D012121:Respiration, Artificial;D012131:Respiratory Insufficiency;D013119:Spinal Cord Injuries;D014139:Tracheostomy;D015300:Ventilator Weaning",trauma
Ketamine for Traumatic Assault-Induced Depression: A Case Report.,"This case report describes the use of ketamine as a rapid, effective treatment of depression in a 68-year-old female patient with no significant medical history of psychiatric disorders. Patients who experience intentional or unintentional traumas are at an increased risk for developing depression or posttraumatic stress disorder, and emerging evidence has supported the use of ketamine as an alternative treatment of depression. This is the case of a 68-year-old female patient who was assaulted, resulting in multiple stab wounds to both hands and the right upper quadrant. She underwent placement of a chest tube and surgical repair of the liver and was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit. These events led to the development of severe depression symptoms, as evidenced by a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of 37. As treatment of her acute depression, the patient received a single intravenous dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infused over 40 min and was monitored for side effects. The MADRS is a 10-item depression screening tool that assesses symptoms and changes over time. Within 4 hr of receiving ketamine, the patient reported a significant improvement in her mood and her MADRS score decreased to 16, classifying this patient as experiencing mild depression. The patient continued to improve, and 24 hr after receiving ketamine, her MADRS score was 4, indicating remission of her depression symptoms. This case report aims to provide an account of the potential benefits of ketamine as a rapid treatment of depression in an adult trauma patient.","D000368:Aged;D005260:Female;D006801:Humans;D003863:Depression;D007262:Infusions, Intravenous;D007649:Ketamine;D013313:Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;D016896:Treatment Outcome",trauma
"Impact of a Rounding Tool and Clinical Champion on Trauma Patient Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder.","Early identification and treatment of alcohol misuse among trauma patients is the standard of care for trauma centers. Yet, trauma programs face significant barriers in adherence to sustained alcohol misuse screening. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a rounding tool and clinical champion on screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment compliance rates for alcohol use disorder in trauma patients. This is a single-center, retrospective cohort design measuring the impact of a nursing rounding tool and clinical champion on screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment for alcohol use disorder in trauma patients older than 14 years. Retrospective reviews were conducted over a 5-year period from 2017 to 2021 for all admitted trauma patients as defined by the National Trauma Data Standard. More than 5,000 trauma patients were included during the study period. The nurses' rounding tool and clinical champion intervention led to an increase in the alcohol use disorder screening rate from an average of 59% for the first 3 months of the study (May to July 2017) to 95% for the last 3 months of the study (March to May 2021).

Geospatial Mapping to Target Injury Prevention for Older Adult Ground-Level Falls: A Feasibility Study.,"Trauma centers target injury prevention efforts based on trauma registry and local epidemiological data. Identifying geographic patterns of injury through geospatial mapping has emerged as a technology to help identify at-risk individuals. Yet, the feasibility of using spatial analysis to target injury prevention efforts remains unknown. This study aims to demonstrate the use of geospatial mapping of older adult ground-level falls to target injury prevention efforts. This retrospective cohort analysis of ground-level falls among older adults was conducted from 2017 to 2020 at a Level I trauma center and safety net hospital. Trauma admissions, U.S. census median income, Hispanic percentage, and population density by zip codes were combined to create choropleth and heat maps to identify injury hot spots to target fall prevention classes. A total of 5,629 patients were reviewed, of which 3,002 (53%) were fall cases. Low-level falls (<10 ft) accounted for 2,224 cases; 1,449 were among older adults centered around the study hospital. Ground-level falls accounted for 1,663 patients, of whom 1,182 were older adults clustering around senior housing, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and rehabilitation centers. As a result, our fall prevention classes are now targeted at these newly identified locations. Geospatial analysis provided powerful visualization of fall injury locations to target our fall prevention efforts.

COVID-19 Pandemic Effects on Clinical Outcomes of Hip Fractures Among Pediatric and Adult Patients.,"Little is known about the distribution and outcomes of hip fractures in pediatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the clinical outcomes of both pediatric and adult patients who underwent hip fracture surgeries and determine the effects of changes surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Both pediatric and adult surgical hip fracture cases were analyzed from the pandemic year (2020) and the control year (2019) using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Between the prepandemic (control) and pandemic years, a total of 2,438 pediatric and 28,180 adult cases were compared. Pediatric patients had similar perioperative characteristics and outcomes between the two years. Significantly fewer hip fractures were reported among adults during the pandemic (p < .001). Preoperatively, more adult patients had ventilator dependence (p = .020), transfusions (p = .029), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (p < .001) in 2020. Adult operations were more likely to be emergent in 2020 (p < .001) and adults had more severe disease states. Length of stay (p < .001) and the time from operation to discharge (p < .001) were significantly longer for the adult cohort in 2020. Mortality was also higher for adults during the first year of the pandemic (p = .003), and superficial surgical site infections became more common (p = .036). Pediatric hip fracture patients had similar clinical outcomes between 2019 and 2020. Adults with hip fractures presented in more serious clinical conditions, which resulted in higher mortality in 2020. Further studies could better clarify the reasons as to why adult hip fracture patients had markedly worse clinical course during the COVID year than pediatric patients.",D006801:Humans;D000328:Adult;D002648:Child;D000086382:COVID-19;D058873:Pandemics;D012189:Retrospective Studies;D007902:Length of Stay;D006620:Hip Fractures,trauma
Quality Improvement Practices and Resources Targeting Firearm Injuries: A Survey of U.S. Pediatric Trauma Centers.,"The increase in firearm injuries at U.S. pediatric trauma centers is a national public health crisis. This spike in penetrating trauma has challenged even the most mature pediatric trauma centers. This project aims to identify U.S. pediatric trauma center best practices for the evaluation and resources dedicated to pediatric firearm injuries. This study used an exploratory cross-sectional survey design using a study-specific questionnaire. An electronic survey was distributed to 159 verified U.S. pediatric trauma centers targeting patients younger than 15 years with firearm injuries from 2017 to 2021. Trauma approaches to injury prevention, advocacy, and common performance improvement events were surveyed. A follow-up survey provided a drill-down on the top three performance improvement events. A total 159 surveys were distributed, of which 63 (40%) submitted partial responses and 32 (20%) completed the initial survey in full. A 49% increase in pediatric firearm injuries occurred between 2019 and 2020. Eighty-six percent of the trauma centers identified at least one to two opportunities for improvement events related to firearm injuries, with most of these events requiring a tertiary level of review. The top three performance improvement events included the massive transfusion protocol/fluid resuscitation, emergency department procedures, and operating room resource availability. This study provides the first known examination of U.S. pediatric trauma center quality improvement efforts to address the crisis of pediatric firearm injuries. Our results indicate that most pediatric trauma centers are engaged in quality improvement and resource enhancement to combat firearm injuries.","D002648:Child;D006801:Humans;D014193:Trauma Centers;D005389:Firearms;D014948:Wounds, Gunshot;D058996:Quality Improvement;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D011795:Surveys and Questionnaires;D012189:Retrospective Studies",trauma

Trauma Patient Transitions From Critical Care: A Survey of U.S. Trauma Centers.,"Transitions between clinical units are vulnerable periods for patients. A significant body of evidence describes the importance of structured transitions, but there is limited reporting of what happens. Describing transitions within a conceptual model will characterize the salient forces that interact during a patient transition and, perhaps, lead to improved outcomes. To describe the processes and resources that trauma centers use to transition patients from critical care to nonintensive care units. This cross-sectional study surveyed all Level I and II trauma centers listed in the American Trauma Society database from September 2020 to November 2020. Data were merged from the American Hospital Association 2018 Hospital Survey. A total of 567 surveys were distributed, of which 152 responded for a (27%) response rate. Results were organized in categories: capital input, organizational facets, employee behavior, employee terms/scope, and labor inputs. Resources and processes varied; the most important opportunities for transition improvement included: (1) handoff instruments were only reported at 36% (n = 27) of trauma centers, (2) mandatory resident education about transitions was only reported at 70% (n = 16) of trauma centers, and (3) only 6% (n = 4) of trauma centers reported electronic medical record applications that enact features to influence employee behavior.

Measuring Emergency Department Staff Perceptions of Causes and Management of Violence.,"Half of all reported violent incidents in health care settings occur in the emergency department (ED) placing all staff members at risk. However, research typically does not include all ED work groups or validated measures beyond nurses and physicians. The aims of this study were to (a) validate an established instrument measuring perceptions of causes of violence and attitudes toward managing violence within an inclusive workforce sample; and (b) explore variation in perceptions, attitudes, and incidence of violence and safety to inform a violence prevention program. This is an investigator-initiated single-site cross-sectional survey design assessing the psychometric properties of the Management of Aggression and Violence Attitude Scale (MAVAS) within a convenience sample (n = 134). Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis and reliability was evaluated by the Cronbach's α estimation. Descriptive, correlational, and inferential estimates explored differences in perceptions, attitudes, and incidence of violence and safety. Exploratory factor analysis indicated validity of the MAVAS with a seven-factor model. Its internal consistency was satisfactory overall (Cronbach's α= 0.87) and across all subscales (Cronbach's α values = 0.52-0.80). Significant variation in incidence of physical assault, perceptions of safety, and causes of violence was found between work groups. The MAVAS is a valid and reliable tool to measure ED staff members' perceptions of causes of violence and attitudes toward managing violence. In addition, it can inform training according to differences in work group learner needs.","D006801:Humans;D015203:Reproducibility of Results;D003430:Cross-Sectional Studies;D014754:Violence;D000374:Aggression;D001291:Attitude of Health Personnel;D004636:Emergency Service, Hospital;D011795:Surveys and Questionnaires;D064450:Workplace Violence",trauma

The Application of Neoprene Diving Boots in Reduction of Feet Injuries in the Sowing Process Among the Rice Farmers in Thailand.,"Foot injuries have been a problem among Thai farmers for a long time. The sowing process is one of the high-risk processes because farmers have to walk in the field to spray rice seed without footwear. Literature review showed that cuts from stepping on sharp material or snail shells were major sources of injury. Traditional footwear such as Ninja shoes or cloth socks have raised the questions regarding their ability in protection from such injuries. This study investigates using Neoprene diving boots to protect from foot injuries during the rice sowing process. The sample from this study were farmers from Sena District, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, Thailand. 29 farmer wearing Neoprene diving boots, 7 farmers wearing traditional Ninja shoes, and 19 farmers wearing cloth socks were asked to work in the sowing process and interviewed about any foot injuries that may have occurred. The statistical test showed there were no significant differences in characteristics among each group of farmers, except for work experience. The result show that there were no foot injuries in farmers wearing Neoprene diving boots, whereas 73% of farmers wearing Ninja shoes, and 14% of farmers wearing cloth socks still had foot injuries. Most injuries were alaceration that were caused by the golden apple snail. The satisfaction survey showed that farmers were satisfied and strongly satisfied with all of the aesthetics, utilization, and functionality factors. This study suggested that the Neoprene diving boots can be recommended for farmers to use as safeguarding against foot injuries in the rice sowing process.",Neoprene diving boots;foot injuries;rice sowing process,trauma
A Summary of Fatal Injury Surveillance Methods in Australian Agriculture and Their Impact on Safety Policies and Practices.,"Agriculture is one of the most important and also hazardous industries in Australia. Having a sound knowledge and understanding of the circumstance of injury events is critical to developing evidence-based intervention programs. This paper aims to provide a brief historical snapshot of the development of data systems underpinning the assessment of fatal farm injury in Australia and how it has impacted on safety policy and practice. The first Australian studies used coronial information to explore agricultural fatalities, these studies reviewed paper based records (in-situ) and collected the information for analysis and reporting. This task was laborious and costly. When the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) was established in 2000, this allowed access to coronial records online. Information provided about the deceased includes demographics, contextual detail on the nature of the fatality and autopsy, toxicology, and police reports, as-well-as the coroner's finding. Information from the NCIS, along with media reports, have been used to develop the farm fatality database. This information has been used to inform the goals and targets for critical farming groups, identification of key risks, development of prevention material and research papers, providing long-term benchmarking of indicators, plus information to underpin training resources. Without providing accurate, timely, concise and relevant data about injury occurring on farms or due to agricultural work, there is no evidence to drive policy and practice or to evaluate programs of work. As such, the continued utilization and extension of the NCIS data will prove crucial to further reducing the burden of preventable fatal injuries on Australian farms.",Agriculture;death;farm;injury,trauma
A chimeric medial femoral condyle chondro-osseus flap with two thin periosteal flaps to reconstruct partial necrosis of talar body: A case report.,"Total talar extrusion is a rare complication of high-energy traumas. A consequence of this injury can be avascular necrosis (AVN) of the talus. Patients are confronted with pain, limited range of motion and post-traumatic arthritis. As AVN progresses the talus is gradually destroyed. This report presents the use of a chimeric medial femoral condyle chondro-osseus flap with two thin periosteal flaps to increase vascular supply to the traumatized area, accelerate bone formation, flap integration, and restore articular surfaces in a patient with partial necrosis of talar body. The patient was a 26-year-old female with open left lateral talar extrusion after a motor-vehicle accident that developed a partial avascular necrosis, at the level of the subtalar and ankle joint with altered talar dome surface with partial depression of 2 cm. The patient was in pain and not able to walk. The medial femoral condyle chondro-osseus portion was placed in the talar dome depression to restore the subtalar joint, the periosteal flaps were placed on top to reconstruct the ankle joint restoring the articular surfaces and the correct weight-bearing distribution. No complications or morbidity of donor site were observed. One year after the operation, the patient walks free, without pain. Post-operatory x-ray performed, evidenced progressive bone healing and reduction of the AVN. In the intent of performing a joint-saving procedure, the presented chimeric flap might be effective in the short-term with excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes.",,trauma

Effective Optical Zone and Centration Following SMILE and FS-LASIK for High Myopia Calculated With a Novel Method.,"To compare the effective optical zone (EOZ) and centration in eyes with high myopia after small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) using a novel method. Forty eyes of 40 consecutive patients with high myopia scheduled for SMILE or FS-LASIK were enrolled in the study. The EOZ, optical zone decentration, and corneal aberrations were analyzed using Scheimpflug imaging. These values were then analyzed and compared between the two procedures 6 months after surgery. The mean EOZ diameter for SMILE (4.41 ± 0.14 mm) was larger than that for FS-LASIK (4.24 ± 0.28 mm; P = .002), corresponding to reductions of 1.60 ± 0.11 and 1.71 ± 0.21 mm, respectively, compared with the programmed optical zone (POZ) (P = .007). Moreover, the total decentration for SMILE (0.33 ± 0.12 mm) was greater than that for FS-LASIK (0.27 ± 0.15 mm; P = .020). The induction of spherical aberration (SA) was lower with SMILE than with FS-LASIK (P = .007). A larger EOZ and less SA were observed after SMILE than after FS-LASIK in eyes with high myopia.

Ankle Biomechanics During Multidirectional Landings in Athletes With Chronic Ankle Instability.,"Assessing and understanding the control of the ankle during multidirectional jump landings in athletes with chronic ankle instability (CAI) would help health professionals develop interventions to reduce the risk of recurrent injuries. The aim of this study was to investigate the angle, angular velocity, and movements of the ankle joint, and the muscle activity of peroneus longus (PL), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius (GAS) muscles during multidirectional landings in athletes with CAI. Nineteen athletes with CAI (≤25 Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool-Thai Score) participated. A Vicon Nexus motion analysis system synchronously collected data with an AMTI force plate and surface electromyography (EMG) to capture kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity, respectively. Participants were asked to perform single-leg jump-landing tests in forward (0°), 30° diagonal, 60° diagonal, and lateral (90°) directions. Ankle joint kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity of PL, TA, and GAS were analyzed. Repeated measure ANOVA (analysis of variance) and Friedman tests were used to analyze the main effects of the jump-landing direction. Athletes with CAI exhibited significant differences in ankle angles, angular velocities, ankle movements, and average muscle activity of GAS between directions. Greatest average EMG of GAS muscle was observed during landing in the lateral direction compared with the forward and 30° diagonal directions. Lateral and diagonal direction movements showed the greatest risks associated with recurrent ankle sprains. Impairments of neuromuscular control in both pre-landing and landing phases were observed in athletes with CAI when considered alongside previously published data.

Interventions Targeting Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in United States Black Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence: A Systematic Review.,"There is a dearth of evidence indicating the effectiveness of psychological interventions targeting depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for Black women in the United States (US) exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV). We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EBSCOhost, Social Sciences, Social Sciences Full Text, Social Work Abstracts, and Cochrane databases between September 2021 and October 2022, for original studies of randomized control trials (RCTs) reporting depression and/or PTSD interventions delivered to US Black women with histories of IPV. Of the 1,276 articles, 46 were eligible and 8 RCTs were ultimately included in the review; interventions for depression (four interventions, n = 1,518) and PTSD (four interventions, n = 477). Among Depression and PTSD interventions (one intervention, n = 208), Beck's Depression Inventory II indicated M = 35.2, SD = 12.6 versus M = 29.5, SD = 13.1, <.01, and Davidson Trauma Scale indicated M = 79.4, SD = 31.5 versus M = 72.1, SD = 33.5, <.01, at pre- and post-intervention respectively. Also, some interventions reported severity of depression M = 13.9 (SD = 5.4) versus M = 7.9 (SD = 5.7) < 0.01, and PTSD (M = 8.08 vs. M = 14.13, F(1,117) = 9.93, p < .01) at pre- and post-intervention respectively.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell‑derived exosomes: A novel therapeutic agent for tendon‑bone healing (Review).,"In sports medicine, injuries related to the insertion of tendons into bones, including rotator cuff injuries, anterior cruciate ligament injuries and Achilles tendon ruptures, are commonly observed. However, traditional therapies have proven to be insufficient in achieving satisfactory outcomes due to the intricate anatomical structure associated with these injuries. Adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells possess self‑renewal and multi‑directional differentiation potential and can generate various mesenchymal tissues to aid in the recovery of bone, cartilage, adipose tissue and bone marrow hematopoietic tissue. In addition, extracellular vesicles derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells known as exosomes, contain lipids, proteins and nucleic acids that govern the tissue microenvironment, facilitate tissue repair and perform various biological functions. Studies have demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell‑derived exosomes can function as natural nanocapsules for drug delivery and can enhance tendon‑bone healing strength. The present review discusses the latest research results on the role of exosomes released by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in tendon‑bone healing and provides valuable information for implementing these techniques in regenerative medicine and sports health.",D006801:Humans;D055354:Exosomes;D013710:Tendons;D000070636:Rotator Cuff Injuries;D014945:Wound Healing;D059630:Mesenchymal Stem Cells,trauma
"Cumulative trauma, adversity, and loss among juvenile justice-involved girls: Implications for health disparities.","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are social determinants of health that increase morbidity and mortality and are prevalent among juvenile justice-involved (JJI) youth. ACEs drive health-risk behaviors (e.g., substance use) that reflect maladaptive coping, increase arrest risk, and overlap with posttraumatic risk-seeking theoretically and reckless/self-destructive behaviors diagnostically. However, little is known, especially among girls, about cumulative developmental adversity burden distress (i.e., total cumulative/lifespan stressor reactivity, grief-specific and adversity-related symptoms, and adversity-driven maladaptive coping strategies by age 18) and associated health risk impacts. Therefore, we assessed (a) developmental adversity burden indicators capturing expanded ACEs (E-ACEs; reflecting cumulative losses and traumatic events), cumulative distress, and risk characteristics; (b) potential racial/ethnic differences in developmental adversity burden; and (c) predictors of maladaptive coping among 223 JJI girls. Participants averaged 15 E-ACEs, endorsing 61.0% of stressor reactivity reactions, 58.4% of cumulative grief-specific symptoms, 55.7% (avoidance) to 73.2% (arousal) of adversity-related symptoms, and 45.0% of adversity-driven maladaptive coping strategies. White JJI girls endorsed significantly higher stressor reactivity and maladaptive coping than Latina girls (e.g., 38.8% vs. 14.6% suicide attempts), ds = 0.56-0.71. Adaptive LASSO analyses of maladaptive coping highlighted primary contributions from stressor reactivity, arousal alterations (excluding reckless/self-destructive behaviors), and cognition/mood alterations but not E-ACEs, grief, avoidance, or intrusions. Participants reported high levels of all cumulative developmental adversity burden indicators (e.g., 81.6% reported reckless/self-destructive behaviors). Results support cumulative, adversity-informed, universal precautions and assessments. Further, emotion regulation interventions targeting stressor reactivity, cognition/mood alterations, and/or arousal alterations may be useful for JJI youth with maladaptive coping.",,trauma
An empirical investigation of definitions of subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder.,"Subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has long been recognized as an important construct that identifies a subgroup of individuals who report significant PTSD symptoms and associated disability but do not endorse enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a full PTSD diagnosis. Different investigators have defined subthreshold PTSD in various ways, making it difficult to interpret findings across studies. To address this problem, we systematically compared individuals who met criteria for nine different subthreshold PTSD definitions with individuals diagnosed with either full PTSD or no PTSD (i.e., failed to meet the criteria for a subthreshold definition) with respect to prevalence and associated clinical outcomes of interest. Participants were 1,082 veterans enrolled in the Veterans After Discharge Longitudinal Registry. PTSD and subthreshold PTSD diagnostic status were determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) and validated self-report instruments were used to assess clinical outcomes. Across outcomes, subthreshold definitions generally identified a group of participants that was distinguishable from participants in both the PTSD and no PTSD groups, rs = .02-.47. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various subthreshold definitions and highlight the need for additional work evaluating these definitions across additional outcomes and samples. In the interim, we propose a working case definition of subthreshold PTSD as meeting any three of the four DSM-5 symptom criteria (i.e., Criteria B, C, D, and E) along with Criterion A and Criteria F-H. The results suggest subthreshold PTSD is a clinically meaningful construct.",,trauma
Ferroptosis contributes to hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia‑induced brain damage in vivo and in vitro.,"Ferroptosis is driven by iron‑dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides, and hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia causes accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin and iron. The present study aimed to assess the role of ferroptosis in hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia‑induced brain damage (HHIBD). Rats were randomly divided into the control, phenylhydrazine (PHZ) and deferoxamine (DFO) + PHZ groups, with 12 rats in each group. Ferroptosis‑associated biochemical and protein indicators were measured in the brain tissue of rats. We also performed tandem mass tag‑labeled proteomic analysis. The levels of iron and malondialdehyde were significantly higher and levels of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase activity significantly lower in the brain tissues of the PHZ group compared with those in the control group. HHIBD also resulted in significant increases in the expression of the ferroptosis‑related proteins acyl‑CoA synthetase long‑chain family member 4, ferritin heavy chain 1 and transferrin receptor and divalent metal transporter 1, as well as a significant reduction in the expression of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed proteins of rat brain tissues between the control and PHZ groups were significantly involved in ferroptosis, GSH metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Pretreatment with DFO induced antioxidant activity and alleviated lipid peroxidation‑mediated HHIBD. In addition, PC12 cells treated with ferric ammonium citrate showed shrinking mitochondria, high mitochondrial membrane density, and increased lipid reactive oxygen species and intracellular ferrous iron, which were antagonized by pretreatment with ferrostatin‑1 or DFO, which was reversed by pretreatment with ferrostatin‑1 or DFO. The present study demonstrated that ferroptosis is involved in HHIBD and provided novel insights into candidate proteins that are potentially involved in ferroptosis in the brain during hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia.",D051381:Rats;D000818:Animals;D000079403:Ferroptosis;D040901:Proteomics;D017209:Apoptosis;D007501:Iron;D006932:Hyperbilirubinemia;D001930:Brain Injuries;D001921:Brain;D006461:Hemolysis;D005978:Glutathione;D008055:Lipids,trauma
In vivo efficacy of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy: A systematic review of animal models.,"We report on a systematic review of the efficacy of turmeric derivatives for the in vivo treatment of peripheral neuropathies. Our review protocol followed the PRISMA Statement. The Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and Scielo databases were used. The search strategy was (""neuropathy"" OR ""neuropathies"" OR ""nerve injury"" OR ""nerve injuries"") AND (""curcumin"" OR ""turmeric yellow"" OR ""yellow, turmeric"" OR ""diferuloylmethane""). Eligibility criteria were in vivo animal models, published in English, Portuguese, Spanish, or French, evaluating the efficacy of turmeric derivatives in the treatment of peripheral neuropathies. We have included 30 papers, and all consisted of pre-clinical trials with good methodological quality. Animals treated with turmeric derivatives (i.e., curcumin, curcumin by-products and curcumin loaded delivery systems) demonstrated remarkable amelioration in the injuries caused by diabetic and sciatic neuropathy, as well as for vincristine, cisplatin, and alcohol-induced neuropathy, especially with regards to the functional recovery of the affected nerve. Turmeric has great potential for the treatment of peripheral neuropathies, including those associated with diabetes mellitus. Clinical trials still need to be performed to assess the feasibility of human treatment as an alternative or adjuvant to existing pharmacological therapy.","D000818:Animals;D006801:Humans;D010523:Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;D030024:Curcuma;D003474:Curcumin;D023421:Models, Animal",trauma
Formulation and In-vivo Characterization of 177Lu-tin-colloid as a Radiosynovectomy Agent.,"Arthritis is an inflammatory disorder that affects one or more joints of the body for various reasons, including autoimmune disorders, trauma, or infection. In many cases, traditional long-term treatment with various drug combinations (NSAIDs, diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs, systemic corticosteroids, etc.) can provide relief, but many joints require additional local treatment. Radiosynovectomy (RSV) is an alternative method to current treatment options. Both the global supply shortage of 90Y in recent years and the increasing use of 177Lu-labeled radiopharmaceuticals in the field of nuclear medicine have made it possible to develop 177Lu-labeled microparticles and test them in small groups as RSV agents. This study aimed to develop the 177Lu labeled tin colloid formulation and demonstrate its invivo characterization. Particle size, shape, and labelling efficiency of the four formulations developed were determined. The formula with the highest labelling efficiency was selected for further studies. The quality of the formulation was evaluated based on radionuclidic, radiochemical, and microbial purity. In-vitro stability was evaluated by determining the labelling efficiency. In-vitro stability was tested in PBS and synovial fluid. The biological characterization was assessed using SPECT/CT after injecting the formulation into the normal knee joints of the rabbits. Aggregated colloidal particles were spherical with a particle size of <5μm. Labelling efficiency and radiochemical purity were >95 and 97.65% (Rf=0.2), respectively. The formulation was stable in vitro for up to 72 hours, both in PBS and synovial fluid. The formulation was homogeneously distributed in the joint at 0 and 1 hour after injection, and radioactivity- related involvement and inguinal lymph node involvement due to possible leakage were not detected in the late period. No pyrogenic/allergic side effects were observed during this period. 177Lu-tin-colloid was successfully prepared under optimized reaction conditions with high binding efficiency and radiochemical purity. The radiolabeled colloid was found to be stable in-vitro both in PBS and synovial fluid at room temperature. Serial PCET/CT images revealed that the activity was completely retained within the synovial cavity, with no activity leakage out of the joint until 48 hours after the injection. With the support of the results from further clinical studies, it may be possible for the formulation to enter clinical use.",177Lu-lutetium;177Lu-tin colloid;177Lutesium;Radiosynovectomy;arthritis;synovectomy,trauma

Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation in the Shoulder: A Systematic Review of Indications and Outcomes.,"To collate current literature pertaining to the published reports of indications for, and outcomes of, osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantations in the shoulder so as to guide surgeons in the management of various etiologies of osteochondral lesions in this joint. A systematic review of the current literature was performed in February 2022 in the PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases using specific search terms and predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. One-hundred-twenty-three articles were initially identified, 30 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 17 articles met inclusion criteria. Data were collected for study characteristics, etiology, lesion size/location, intervention/type of graft used, follow-up, and outcomes. In total, 83 shoulders were included (n = 83) in the review with an average follow-up of 45.7 months. Nine specific indications for OCA transplantation in the shoulder included: reverse Hill-Sachs lesions (33), Hill-Sachs lesions (22), pain pump chondrolysis (10), recurrent shoulder instability (7), osteoarthritis/degenerative changes (5), radiofrequency chondrolysis (2), prominent suture anchors (2), glenoid lesion (1), and osteochondritis dissecans (1). Seventeen patients had concomitant surgeries and two patients were lost to follow-up. Of the total 83 shoulders, 68 had favorable outcomes and 13 had unfavorable outcomes as determined by graft incorporation, pain scores, functionality/ROM, patient-reported satisfaction, and/or requirement for revision/arthroplasty. Of the 13 with unfavorable outcomes, a disproportionate number had concomitant surgeries and/or were performed for pain pump chondrolysis (6). The use of OCAs appears to be a viable option for a variety of difficult-to-treat shoulder pathologies, particularly those characterized by isolated osteochondral injuries.",biologics;cartilage;glenohumeral joint;osteochondral allograft,trauma
Evaluation of changes of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) expression in cervix-uterus and placental axis in an LPS-induced preterm labor model.,"Although preterm birth is among the preventable causes of maternal and infant death, its mechanism has not yet been clarified. When evaluated in terms of the results, the psycho-social burden of mother-infant losses and the costs of rehabilitation, care, and treatment for postpartum sequelae are high. When evaluated in terms of its causes, infection/inflammation has an important place. Therefore, it is essential to understand the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins in the process. In our study, apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) expression in the cervix-uterus and placental axis were evaluated at tissue and protein levels in pregnant and non-pregnant control, sham, PBS, and LPS groups in the infection model in which LPS induction was performed by midline laparotomy, in CD-1 mice. The evaluation of this axis regarding apelin and apelin receptor in the preterm birth model is new in the literature. Apelin is expressed more intensely in uterine epithelial cells than in the cervix. In the placenta, expression is more intense in the junctional zone compared to other zones. Apelin protein levels decrease significantly in the cervix and placenta whereas it increases in the uterus. While no change was observed in the expression of the apelin receptor at the tissue and protein level in the cervix and uterus, it increased in both aspects in the placenta in the invasive procedure groups. We propose that the decrease in apelin protein due to LPS in the preterm delivery model may be related to the effort to compensate for the balance deteriorated in the pro-inflammatory direction with post-transitional modification at the tissue level. The tendency of apelin to increase with pregnancy has led to the conclusion that it is necessary for a healthy pregnancy. Although the apelin receptor does not change with inflammation, it is necessary to investigate the mechanisms associated with its stress and trauma-induced increase, since it increases in the invasive procedure group.","D006801:Humans;D005260:Female;D011247:Pregnancy;D051379:Mice;D000818:Animals;D010920:Placenta;D000075244:Apelin Receptors;D000073861:Apelin;D002584:Cervix Uteri;D008070:Lipopolysaccharides;D047928:Premature Birth;D014599:Uterus;D007752:Obstetric Labor, Premature;D007249:Inflammation",trauma
Autophagy protects against vocal fold injury-induced fibrosis.,"Vocal fold scar formation due to vocal fold injury (VFI) is a common cause of surgery or trauma-induced voice disorders. Severe scar formation can lead to reduced voice quality or even be life-threatening. Here we investigated the role of autophagy in VFI, focusing on fibrosis as a consequence of autophagy in inducing VFI. A VFI model was constructed in rats by dissecting the lamina propria tissue from the thyroarytenoid muscle. Real-time PCR and western blot were used to analyze expressions of autophagy markers, including Beclin1 and Atg7, in VFI. Tgfb1 and Col1a1 were assessed to determine the correlation of fibrosis with VFI progression and autophagy levels. Rat vocal fold fibroblasts were also treated with TGF-β1 or rapamycin, which activates and suppresses autophagy respectively, to explore how autophagy regulates fibrosis in VFI. Initially, we observed that autophagy was downregulated in vocal fold mucosa after VFI in rats. This was particularly evident by the time-dependent downregulation of Beclin1 and Atg7 following VFI. Concurrently, levels of Tgfb1 and Col1a1 also surged, hinting at elevated fibrosis levels. Furthermore, our experiments with TGF-β1 stimulation revealed that it inhibited autophagy in rat vocal fold fibroblasts. Interestingly, when we introduced rapamycin, this effect was reversed. Our data suggest that autophagy is a suppressor of VFI by alleviating fibrosis, making targeting autophagy a potential therapeutic route in VFI.",Autophagy;fibrosis;vocal fold injury,trauma
Utilization of rehabilitation services in violent versus non-violent traumatic spinal cord injury.,"Violence is the third leading cause of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States, and people with violence-related SCI have worse long-term outcomes compared to other traumatic SCI etiologies. Little is known, however, about the underlying reasons for these differences. Access to and utilization of rehabilitation services may differ in this population, but their outpatient care has not been previously investigated. To evaluate differences in utilization patterns of outpatient rehabilitation services between people with violence-related SCI and other traumatic SCI etiologies. Retrospective cohort study. Academic tertiary care hospital system PATIENTS: 41 patients with violence-related SCI residing in King County at the time of injury who completed inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) in our institution were identified from the hospital trauma registry and matched with 41 control patients with non-violent traumatic SCI. Not applicable. The number of appointments attended, canceled, and missed during the first year after discharge from IPR were obtained by chart review for Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R) physicians and therapy services. People with violence-related SCI had decreased follow-up with outpatient rehabilitation services after IPR discharge compared to non-violent traumatic SCI, including PM&R (2.50±2.44 vs. 3.76±2.21 visits, β=-1.28, p=0.017), physical therapy (8.91±11.02 vs. 17.57±15.26, β=-9.79, p=0.0093), occupational therapy (4.28±7.90 vs. 10.04±14.42, β=-6.18, p=0.033), and recreational therapy (0.293±0.955 vs. 1.37±2.86, β=-1.07, p=0.035). The rate of missed appointments was also higher among people with violence-related SCI compared to controls for PM&R (25.2%±28.5% vs. 9.9%±16.5%, β=14.6%, p=0.014) and physical therapy (26.0%±32.0% vs 4.2%±13.2%, β=22.1%, p=0.009). Individuals with violence-related SCI were less likely to attend follow up appointments with PM&R physicians and other allied health professionals and were more likely to miss scheduled appointments compared to other traumatic SCI etiologies. Decreased outpatient follow-up may affect long-term outcomes for people with violence-related SCI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",,trauma
EXTREMITY TOURNIQUET SELF-APPLICATION BY ANTARCTICA ZODIAC CREW MEMBERS.,"Search and rescue teams and Antarctic research groups use protective cold-water anti-exposure suits (AES) when cruising on Zodiacs. Extremity tourniquet (ET) self-application (SA) donned with AESs has not been previously studied. Our study assessed the SA of five commercial ETs (CAT, OMNA, RATS, RMT, and SWAT-T) among fifteen volunteers who donned these suits. Tourniquet's SA ability, ease of SA, tolerance, and tourniquet preference were measured. All ETs tested were self-applied to the upper extremity except for the SWAT, which was self-applied with the rest to the lower extremity. SA ease mean values were compared using the Friedman and Durbin-Conover post hoc tests (p < 0.001). Regarding the upper extremity, OMNA achieved the highest score of 8.5 out of 10, while RMT and SWAT received lower scores than other options (p<0.001). For lower extremities, SWAT was found to be inferior to other options (p<0.01). Overall, OMNA was the best performer. The RATS showed significantly lower tolerance than the other groups in a repeated measures ANOVA with a Turkey post hoc test (p<0.01). Additionally, out of the five ETs tested, 60% of subjects preferred OMNA. The study concluded that SA commercial ETs are feasible over cold-water anti-exposure suits in the Antarctic climate.",Antarctic regions;extreme cold weather;immersion suits;tourniquets,trauma
Does injury risk increase when youth athletes start to study at a sports high school?,"The injury risk is high in adolescent elite athletes. However, little is known about how the injury risk changes when young talented athletes start studying at a sports high school. The primary aim was therefore to explore the risk of injury when the athlete starts to study at a sports high school. A secondary aim was to identify risk factors for injury. A total of 489 athletes (age 15-16 years) were followed for 20 weeks, including 10 weeks before and 10 weeks after the athlete had started to study at a sports high school. Substantial injury was monitored in adolescent elite athletes using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre Questionnaire. The results showed that the mean difference (md) in injury prevalence was significantly (p=0.001) higher across the 10 weeks after school had started (md 3.6; 95% CI 1.5 to 5.8), compared with the 10 weeks before. Female athletes had significantly (p<0.001) higher injury prevalence (md 6.4%; 95% CI 3.0 to 9.8) across the 10 weeks after school had started, whereas male athletes (md 0.9%; 95% CI -1.8 to 3.6) had not (p=0.530). Three significant (p<0.05) risk factors were identified; previous injury within the past 12 months (OR 3.23), higher training volume (OR 0.97) and lower well-being (OR 0.71). Our results provide supporting evidence for increased injury risk in female adolescent elite athletes after the athletes had started to study at a sports high school.",injury;risk factor;young,trauma
Experiences of rehabilitation in young elite athletes: an interview study.,"Even though injuries are common in elite youth sports, rehabilitation experiences are limited explored in young athletes. This study explored rehabilitation experiences in athletes with a previous injury studying at sports high schools. Twenty-six (14/12 females/males) young elite athletes (age 15-19 years) from 11 individual/team sports were interviewed in focus groups about the rehabilitation experiences following a sports injury. Data were analysed using content analysis. The results led to four main categories identified: 'High-quality rehabilitation', 'Lack of communication between healthcare and coach', 'Various consequences of injury' and 'No clear path to accessing rehabilitation'. The athletes valued that the healthcare providers had high expertise, were clear and signalled secureness and confidence. It was also important to receive help with rehabilitation as rapidly as possible. The athletes perceived that they felt responsible for providing information regarding rehabilitation progression between healthcare providers and their coach. It was also challenging not to be able to participate in training and competition while injured - causing a sense of frustration and fear of falling behind their peer athletes in terms of development and performance. The athletes described that no well-defined medical teams at the sports high schools were available- instead medical help was offered in several other ways. Based on our findings, the collaboration and communication between the healthcare providers and coaches need to be improved, addressing the rehabilitation content, progress and access to rehabilitation. Through these actions, the rehabilitation process will be more adjusted to the needs of young elite athletes.",Adolescent;Injury;Muscle damage/injuries;Qualitative Research,trauma
Exploring the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and comorbid heart disease in Americans with mood disorders: a cross-sectional nationwide study.,"This study aimed to explore the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and comorbid heart disease in adult inpatients with mood disorders (depressive and bipolar disorders). A cross-sectional investigation was carried out employing the nationwide inpatient dataset, which encompassed 910,561 adult inpatients aged 18 to 50 years diagnosed with depressive and bipolar disorders. Additionally, the sample was categorized based on the presence of comorbid heart disease. We utilized a logistic regression model to assess the odds ratio (OR), pertaining to demographic features and coexisting medical conditions in relation to comorbid heart disease. Comorbid heart disease was present in 1.3% of inpatients with mood disorders; they were middle-aged (mean age 42.7 years) men and White individuals. Inpatients with depressive disorder had a higher risk of comorbid heart disease (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.15-1.24) compared to those with bipolar disorders. Inpatients with comorbid heart disease had a higher prevalence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 2.3% in mood disorders but higher in those with comorbid heart disease (2.9%). Vitamin D deficiency showed a notable correlation with comorbid heart disease, resulting in a 26% increased risk in the unadjusted regression model (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.40). However, after accounting for potential confounding factors, including comorbidities, the risk did not exhibit statistical significance (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97-1.21). Among psychiatric comorbidities, trauma-related (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.17-1.28) and tobacco-related (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.26-1.37) disorders had a higher risk of association with comorbid heart disease. Middle-aged men with depressive disorders and from low-income families had a higher risk of developing comorbid heart disease. Trauma-related and tobacco-related disorders were associated with an increased risk by 20-30% for comorbid heart disease in inpatients with mood disorders. Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with the risk of comorbid heart disease after controlling demographics and comorbid cardiovascular risk factors.",bipolar disorder;heart disease;major depressive disorder;mood disorder;tobacco-related disorders;trauma-related disorders;vitamin D deficiency,trauma
Falciform Ligament Infarction: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"The falciform ligament is a double peritoneal fold that separates the left and right hepatic lobes anatomically. Fatty-falciform ligament appendage torsion (F-FLAT) is defined as torsion of the extraperitoneal fat within the falciform ligament causing fat infarction, which is an uncommon surgical presentation, scarcely documented within the current literature. The objective of presenting this case report and reviewing the literature on F-FLAT is to discuss the clinical presentation, possible associated factors and management strategies in regard to this rare pathology. A 72-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a seven-day history of epigastric pain, reduced appetite and nausea. On admission, the patient was stable and apyrexial with abdominal examination highlighting she was tender in her right upper quadrant and epigastric region. Due to the patient's unremitting abdominal pain despite appropriate analgesia, CT of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) with intravenous contrast was done and a diagnosis of F-FLAT was made. The patient was treated with antibiotics and analgesia, had a negative abdominal ultrasound (US) result and due to her symptoms settling by the second day of admission, she was discharged the same afternoon. A literature review into falciform ligament infarction was conducted by two independent reviewers across four different databases: PubMed, Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Search terms included ""falciform ligament"" OR ""falciform"" AND ""infarction"" (likewise with Medical Subject Headings, or MeSH, terms in the Cochrane Library). Eligibility criteria and our subsequent inclusion criteria were based on studies specifically discussing falciform ligament infarction and published in English. Study types were by majority case reports, but also included one literature review and a book source as well as two pictorial radiological reviews. All 13 patients presented with abdominal pain, but only 53% presented with raised infective/inflammatory markers. The majority of patients had abdominal US as a first-line investigation with 9 of 13 patients also having a CTAP with contrast, which classically showed fat stranding in the falciform ligament. Two patients had no evidence of any radiological investigation. Initially all cases were managed conservatively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesia, but in 62% of the cases (8/13), surgical intervention was needed due to unresolving abdominal pain. All eight of the excised falciform ligaments showed evidence of infarction and necrosis histologically. In conclusion, F-FLAT is a relatively rare condition making it difficult to build higher level evidence studies. The current literature has revealed some evidence of incomplete and inconsistent data, for example, in the biochemical results and management techniques presented, yet contrast-enhanced CT seems moderately sensitive for detection in the reviewed literature. Though F-FLAT is rare and unfamiliar, it is vital we exclude common acute surgical pathologies that F-FLAT mimics and monitor for unsettling symptoms that could change the management trajectory.",case report;f-flat;falciform ligament;falciform ligament infarction;fatty falciform ligament appendage torsion;fflat,trauma
Direct Discharge from the Critical Care Resuscitation Unit: Results from a Longitudinal Assessment.,"The critical care resuscitation unit (CCRU) facilitates interhospital transfer (IHT) of critically ill patients for immediate interventions. Due to these patients' acuity, it is uncommon for patients to be directly discharged home from this unit, but it does happen on occasion. Since there is no literature regarding outcomes of patients being discharged from a resuscitation unit, our study investigated these patients' outcome at greater than 12 months after being discharged directly from the CCRU. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients directly discharged from the CCRU between January 01, 2017, and December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was number of ED visits or hospitalizations within 6 months. Secondary outcomes were number of ED visits or hospitalizations within 6, 12, and >12 months from CCRU discharge. We analyzed 145 patients' records. Mean age was 56 (standard deviation [SD] ± 19), with a majority being male (72%) and Caucasian (58%). The most common discharge destination was home (139 patients, 96% of total subjects) versus hospice (2%) or nursing facilities (2%). Most patients (55%) did not have any hospital revisits within the first 6 months of discharge, while 31% had 1-2 revisits, and 14% had ≥3 revisits. The most common discharge diagnoses were soft tissue infection (16.5%), aortic dissection (14%), and stroke (11%). Factors which were associated with a greater likelihood of any return hospital visit within 6 months receiving mechanical ventilation during CCRU stay (coefficient -2.23, 95% CI 0.01-0.87, P=0.036), while high hemoglobin on CCRU discharge was associated with no ED revisit (coeff. 0.42, 95% CI 1.15-2.06, P=0.004). Most patients who were discharged from the CCRU did not require any hospital revisits in the first 6 months. Requiring mechanical ventilation and having soft tissue infection were associated with high unplanned hospital revisits following discharge. Further research is needed to validate these findings.",,trauma
Online Patient Education Resources for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: An Assessment of the Accuracy and Reliability of Information on the Internet Over the Past Decade.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of patient education materials accessible through popular online search engines regarding anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).  Methods: Two search terms (""ACL surgery"" and ""ACL reconstruction"") were entered into three search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Bing). The quality of information was scored using a novel scoring system developed and overseen by sports medicine orthopedic clinical research fellows and fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons. Website quality, credibility, and readability were further assessed by the DISCERN score, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, and Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level (FKRGL), respectively. The Health On the Net Code of Conduct (HONcode) certification was also utilized to assess the transparency of health information for each website. We evaluated 39 websites. The average score for all websites was 11.2±5.6 out of 28 total points. Six out of the 39 websites (41%) were HONcode certified. The websites that contained HONcode certification had a higher average JAMA benchmark score (3.5±0.7) and DISCERN score (44.6±14.7) when compared to the websites without the certification, 2.2±1.2 and 37.6 ± 15.9 for JAMA and DISCERN, respectively. The mean JAMA benchmark score was 2.7±1.2 (67.5%) for all websites out of a possible four points. The average FKRGL for all 39 websites was 10.0±2.0 (range: 5.4-13). The quality of patient education materials accessible on the internet regarding ACL injuries and ACLR can be misleading and directly impact the patient's decision-making process essential to the patient-physician relationship over the past decade.

Suspensory Device Fixation of Lisfranc Injuries in a Southeast Asian Urban Population: Patient-Reported Functional Outcomes.,"Introduction Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) and primary arthrodesis are two conventional options for the treatment of Lisfranc injuries. However, they are associated with implant-related complications. An alternative suspensory device construct using interosseous nonabsorbable sutures with endobuttons has been described with satisfactory results. This study aims to explore functional outcomes after suture button fixation of Lisfranc injuries in a Southeast Asian population. Methods This was a single-surgeon retrospective study of patients with Lisfranc injuries treated surgically using a suture button fixation technique between 2017 and 2019. Data collected included demographic information, pre-injury levels of activity, nature of injury, and type of surgery performed. The minimum postoperative follow-up was one year. The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) were used to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. Scores were reported in percentage (%) with median and interquartile range. Results Twenty-nine patients with a mean age of 29 years (21-76) were recruited. Sixteen underwent suture button fixation only (SB), and 13 underwent suture button fixation with intercuneiform screw fixation and plating (SBM). The median scores for the FAOS and FAAM questionnaires were at least 80% in all domains. Twenty-eight patients (97%) were able to return to pre-injury activity level, 27 patients (93%) were able to return to sports. Only one patient was not satisfied with the outcomes of surgery. No patients had post-traumatic arthritis or hardware failure necessitating implant removal at the final follow-up. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that treatment of Lisfranc injuries with a suspensory device construct resulted in good outcomes with 97% of patients being able to return to pre-injury activity levels, and 93% of patients being able to return to sports. It may not be necessary to perform primary arthrodesis in uncomplicated Lisfranc injuries. This technique is also advantageous as implant removal is not routinely required due to the design and biomechanical properties of suspensory devices.",foot;lisfranc;orthopaedic;sport injury;suspensory fixation;suture button;trauma,trauma
Immunomodulators and Their Applications in Dentistry and Periodontics: A Comprehensive Review.,"The intricate interplay between the immune system and oral health has revealed opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions in dentistry and periodontics. This review article delves into the pivotal role of immunomodulators in orchestrating immune responses within the oral cavity and their applications in managing various oral and periodontal conditions. The oral environment faces many challenges, from microbial infections to tissue injuries, necessitating a precise immune response for optimal oral health maintenance. Characterized by their ability to modulate immune reactions, immunomodulators emerge as versatile tools for maintaining immune equilibrium. This is a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms through which immunomodulators exert their effects, shedding light on their dual role as regulators of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways. The diverse applications of immunomodulators within dentistry are explored in depth. Immunomodulators exhibit promising outcomes from managing common oral conditions like gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral ulcers to enhancing the integration of dental implants and promoting wound healing post-surgery. This article highlights the various types of immunomodulatory agents utilized in dental practice, elucidating their mechanisms of action, routes of administration, dosages, and potential side effects.",dentistry;immunomodulators;inflammation;oral health;periodontics,trauma
"Patterns and Sociodemographic Characteristics of Substance Abuse Among the Adult Population in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Substance abuse is a term that refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. One of the key impacts of illicit drug use on society is the negative health consequences experienced by its members. This study recorded the pattern of substance abuse and the sociodemographic characteristics of adult substance abusers in Makkah City. An online self-administered survey was provided to the general population through social media platforms between March 2023 and August 2023. Males and females living in Makkah over the age of 18 were included in it. The participants who refused to take part or those who were younger than 18 were not included in the study. The number of participants in this study was 720; 73.5% were under the age of 30 and 424 were females (58.9%). The significant variables between substance abuse and sociodemographic data were gender (P=0.001), depression (P≤0.000), anxiety (P≤0.000), stress (P=0.025), and bad/shocking experience during childhood (P=0.004). Substance abuse positively correlates with sociodemographic data, with males having a higher risk, and psychiatric neurosis is associated with childhood trauma and anxiety.",anxiety;cannabinoids;depression;makkah;psychoactive substance;saudi arabia;smoking;stress;substance abuse,trauma
"The relationship between cognition and white matter tract damage after mild traumatic brain injury in a premorbidly healthy, hospitalised adult cohort during the post-acute period.","Recent developments in neuroimaging techniques enable increasingly sensitive consideration of the cognitive impact of damage to white matter tract (WMT) microstructural organisation after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This study investigated the relationship between WMT microstructural properties and cognitive performance. Using an observational design, a group of 26 premorbidly healthy adults with mTBI and a group of 20 premorbidly healthy trauma control (TC) participants who were well-matched on age, sex, premorbid functioning and a range of physical, psychological and trauma-related variables, were recruited following hospital admission for traumatic injury. All participants underwent comprehensive unblinded neuropsychological examination and structural neuroimaging as outpatients 6-10 weeks after injury. Neuropsychological examination included measures of speed of processing, attention, memory, executive function, affective state, pain, fatigue and self-reported outcome. The WMT microstructural properties were estimated using both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) modelling techniques. Tract properties were compared between the corpus callosum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, anterior corona radiata and three segmented sections of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. For the TC group, in all investigated tracts, with the exception of the uncinate fasciculus, two DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) and one NODDI metric (intra-cellular volume fraction) revealed expected predictive linear relationships between extent of WMT microstructural organisation and processing speed, memory and executive function. The mTBI group showed a strikingly different pattern relative to the TC group, with no relationships evident between WMT microstructural organisation and cognition on most tracts. These findings indicate that the predictive relationship that normally exists in adults between WMT microstructural organisation and cognition, is significantly disrupted 6-10 weeks after mTBI and suggests that WMT microstructural organisation and cognitive function have disparate recovery trajectories.",cognition;diffusion tensor imaging;mild traumatic brain injury;neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI);white matter tract,trauma
Addition of aspirin to venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis safely decreases venous thromboembolism rates in trauma patients.,"Trauma patients exhibit a multifactorial hypercoagulable state and have increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite early and aggressive chemoprophylaxis (CP) with various heparin compounds (""standard"" CP; sCP), VTE rates remain high. In high-quality studies, aspirin has been shown to decrease VTE in postoperative elective surgical and orthopedic trauma patients. We hypothesized that inhibiting platelet function with aspirin as an adjunct to sCP would reduce the risk of VTE in trauma patients. We performed a retrospective observational study of prospectively collected data from all adult patients admitted to an American College of Surgeons Level I Trauma center from January 2012 to June 2015 to evaluate the addition of aspirin (sCP+A) to sCP regimens for VTE mitigation. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the potential benefit of adjunctive aspirin for symptomatic VTE incidence. 10,532 patients, median age 44 (IQR 28 to 62), 68% male, 89% blunt mechanism of injury, with a median Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 12 (IQR 9 to 19), were included in the study. 8646 (82%) of patients received only sCP, whereas 1886 (18%) patients received sCP+A. The sCP+A cohort displayed a higher median ISS compared with sCP (13 vs 11; p<0.01). The overall median time of sCP initiation was hospital day 1 (IQR 0.8 to 2) and the median day for aspirin initiation was hospital day 3 (IQR 1 to 6) for the sCP+A cohort. 353 patients (3.4%) developed symptomatic VTE. Aspirin administration was independently associated with a decreased relative hazard of VTE (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.88; p=0.01). There were no increased bleeding or wound complications associated with sCP+A (point estimate 1.23, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.2, p=0.50). In this large trauma cohort, adjunctive aspirin was independently associated with a significant reduction in VTE and may represent a potential strategy to safely mitigate VTE risk in trauma patients. Further prospective studies evaluating the addition of aspirin to heparinoid-based VTE chemoprophylaxis regimens should be sought.

Intrathoracic plates versus extrathoracic plates: a comparison of postoperative pain in surgical stabilization of rib fracture technique.,"Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has been shown to improve outcomes, yet there is an absence of studies comparing SSRF techniques. An intrathoracic system that minimizes incision length has recently been developed and adopted by multiple institutions. We hypothesized that SSRF with an intrathoracic system plus intercostal nerve cryoneurolysis (IC) leads to improved pain control compared with an extrathoracic system plus IC. A single-center, retrospective chart review was performed comparing intrathoracic SSRF versus extrathoracic SSRF, and included patients undergoing SSRF from 2015 to 2021 at a level 1 trauma center. Patients who did not undergo intercostal nerve cryoablation were excluded. The primary outcome was opioid consumption based on morphine milligram equivalent (MME) consumption. We collected Rib score, Blunt Pulmonary Contusion 18 Score, number of rib fractures, number of ribs plated, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) to compare baseline characteristics of each group. A total of 112 patients were evaluated for study inclusion. Thirty-one patients were excluded due to missing outcomes data and/or lack of cryoablation. There was no difference in ISS or Rib Score between the intrathoracic (n=33) and extrathoracic (n=48) groups. At 7-day follow-up, the median MME requirement was significantly lower in the intrathoracic group (21.25) versus the extrathoracic group (46.20) (p=0.02). Intrathoracic SSRF was associated with a lower postoperative MME consumption compared with extrathoracic SSRF. These data support the use of intrathoracic SSRF to improve pain control compared to extrathoracic SSRF. III.",rib fractures;ribs;thoracic injuries,trauma
Penetrating chest injury secondary to an improvised home-made marble airgun: a case report.,"An improvised air gun with marble bullets, locally known as ""Jolen Gun"", is a type of home-made gun using Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes and compressed air. It is mainly being used as a hunting tool in Central Mindanao. This ""non-lethal"" weapon has the potential in causing serious harm. There has been several incidents of minor injuries from this type of weapon in our institution but this is the first documented case of an improvised marble air-gun causing significant injury to the patient. A child was brought to a rural tertiary center after being shot in the chest using an improvised gun with marble as bullet. On evaluation, the patient had a single gunshot wound approximately 2cm x 2cm in size on the posterior chest at the right paravertebral area of the 4th thoracic vertebra. There was no exit wound noted. Chest CT done showed a rounded radiopaque foreign body seen in the right upper lung field with gunshot fracture involving the posterior aspect of the 4th rib. There was also pulmonary contusion of the right upper lobe and a fluid density at the right posterior pleural space attributed to a hemothorax. Open thoracotomy, removal of foreign body, repair of lung injury and debridement was done. Patient had an unremarkable post-operative course and was subsequently discharged. After extensive search of both local and international literatures, this appears to be the first case involving a penetrating chest injury from an improvised marble air-gun which has been treated successfully. Although this is a low-energy type of weapon, it still has the potential to cause significant harm to the body. Relevant laws should be made to against the use of this type of weapon to prevent similar injuries in the future.","Thoracic Injuries;Wounds, Penetrating",trauma
Factors associated with compartment syndrome after a tibial fracture in children.,"Compartment syndrome (CS) after a tibial fracture in children is one of the orthopedic emergencies. Identifying high-risk patients in a timely fashion minimizes morbidities. This study aimed to find the risk factors of CS after a tibial fracture. The study data was retrieved from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program database of the calendar year 2017-2019. All patients aged <18 years old who were admitted to the hospital with tibial fractures were included in the study. Patients' characteristics, including demography, injury, injury severity, and associated crushed and vascular injuries were analyzed between the groups who developed CS versus those who did not develop CS after a tibial fracture. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to find the association of CS. All p values are two-sided and a p value<0.05 is considered statistically significant. Of 4492 patients who qualified for the study, 49 (1.1%) patients developed CS. The patients who developed CS sustained more crush injuries and were associated with a higher rate of vascular injury (2% vs 0.1%, p=0.043% & 10.2% vs 2.2%, p=0.005). Multivariable analysis showed that for every increase in 1 year of age, the odds of occurrence of CS increased by 15.7% (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.157, 95% CI: 1.032 to 1.297, p=0.013). Non-African American race was associated with more than double the risk of developing CS when compared with the African American race, AOR was 2.238, (95% CI: (1.08 to 4.638)). The associated crush injury had an approximately 19-fold higher risk of CS when compared with patients presented with no crush injury, AOR was 18.812, (95% CI: (1.513 to 233.931)). Associated vascular injury was found to have significantly higher AOR, 3.509, 95% CI: (1.287 to 9.563) of CS. Increased age, non-African American race, vascular injury, and crushed injury were associated with a risk of developing CS after a tibial fracture.

S100 calcium-binding protein A9 promotes skin regeneration through toll-like receptor 4 during tissue expansion.,"In plastic surgery, tissue expansion is widely used for repairing skin defects. However, low expansion efficiency and skin rupture caused by thin, expanded skin remain significant challenges in promoting skin regeneration during expansion. S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) is essential in promoting wound healing; however, its effects on skin regeneration during tissue expansion remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of S100A9 in skin regeneration, particularly collagen production to investigate its importance in skin regeneration during tissue expansion. The expression and distribution of S100A9 and its receptors-toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and receptor for advanced glycation end products were studied in expanded skin. These characteristics were investigated in skin samples of rats and patients. Moreover, the expression of S100A9 was investigated in stretched keratinocytes in vitro. The effects of S100A9 on the proliferation and migration of skin fibroblasts were also observed. TAK-242 was used to inhibit the binding of S100A9 to TLR-4; the levels of collagen I (COL I), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), TLR-4 and phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in fibroblasts were determined. Furthermore, fibroblasts were co-cultured with stretched S100A9-knockout keratinocytes by siRNA transfection and the levels of COL I, TGF-β, TLR-4 and p-ERK1/2 in fibroblasts were investigated. Additionally, the area of expanded skin, thickness of the dermis, and synthesis of COL I, TGF-β, TLR-4 and p-ERK1/2 were analysed to determine the effects of S100A9 on expanded skin. Increased expression of S100A9 and TLR-4 was associated with decreased extracellular matrix (ECM) in the expanded dermis. Furthermore, S100A9 facilitated the proliferation and migration of human skin fibroblasts as well as the expression of COL I and TGF-β in fibroblasts via the TLR-4/ERK1/2 pathway. We found that mechanical stretch-induced S100A9 expression and secretion of keratinocytes stimulated COL I, TGF-β, TLR-4 and p-ERK1/2 expression in skin fibroblasts. Recombined S100A9 protein aided expanded skin regeneration and rescued dermal thinning in rats in vivo as well as increasing ECM deposition during expansion. These findings demonstrate that mechanical stretch promoted expanded skin regeneration by upregulating S100A9 expression. Our study laid the foundation for clinically improving tissue expansion using S100A9.","Mechanical stretch;Regeneration;S100 calcium-binding protein A9;Skin, Soft tissue expansion",trauma
"Injuries related to pets, exotic animals, and falconry in Qatar.","Pets and exotic animals are increasingly popular all over the world. Some of these animals may cause injuries to their owners or other people during interactions. Both injuries and systemic infections always present diagnosis and treatment challenges. Emergency physicians´ clinical experience in managing patients with injuries caused by pets and exotic animals, in particular, is limited; hence, we believe that it is a domain to explore in a Middle Eastern country to help raise awareness and provide reminders as to the best evidence-based medical practice. Hamad Medical Corporation's hospital records of patients treated between 2015 and 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. Cases whose diagnosis was recorded as injuries caused by animals kept as pets were included in the study. Patients were evaluated in terms of demographic characteristics, type of injury, injury locations, injury severity, treatments applied, and complications. Descriptive statistics were carried out, and findings were expressed as percentages in a frequency table. Following a search of the electronic patient records during the period of interest, 43 patients were found to have sought treatment following an injury caused by a pet or domestic exotic animal. The mean age of the patients was 23.5 years; about three-quarters were male, and approximately half were children. All injuries were minor, and 74.4% were skin abrasions. The most commonly injured body parts were the hand, the leg, and facial injuries. It was observed that cats caused 53.5% of the injuries, whereas falcons were involved in 11.6% of the cases. All patients were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics, and 60.5% were administered a tetanus injection. Despite our study spanning over seven years, a relatively low number of patients reported to the government hospitals´ emergency departments. The injuries are most commonly caused by cats and often involve children and animal bites to hands. The key recommendations are for parents or childminders to always supervise children when interacting with animals, be particularly cautious, and wear some form of protection when handling pets and domestic, exotic animals. Whether it is a bite or a scratch, healthcare professionals should always anticipate the potential risk of infection, treat the patient accordingly, and prescribe prophylactic antibiotics.",exotic animal;falconry;injury;pet,trauma
Needle versus Cannula to Treat Tear Trough: A Prospective Study Comparing both Methods.,"We aimed to clinically compare needle and cannula techniques in vivo with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, to better understand the best technique and adverse events. Ten adults without previous fillers in the area were injected with hyaluronic acid (CPM 22.5 HA mg/mL) with a 25G cannula on one side and a Becton Dickinson syringe needle (31G 0.3 mL) on the other. The product was fractionated among two visits. Assessment was made at time 0d, 14d, 30d, 60d, 90d, 180d, and 365d with standard camera, Vectra H2, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Level of satisfaction was also evaluated. All the patients showed natural results with both techniques and a high satisfaction index. Cannulas were minimally less traumatic in terms of bruises. However, the product was applied in a more superficial layer and in a less precise manner, despite the fact that a deep technique was used with cannulas, depositing the product on the orbital bone. Patients reported a more noticeable change immediately after the procedure on the side treated with cannulas but less edema and a more comfortable procedure on the Becton Dickinson syringe treated side. None of the patients required hyaluronidase to dissolve overcorrection of the area, and no severe complications were observed. The product remained in most of them at day 365. Cannulas seem to be less traumatic regarding bruises, but less precise in vivo. Thin needles seem to be more precise with minimal trauma. However, this difference disappears during patient's evolution.",,trauma
Biomechanical evaluation of novel intra- and extramedullary assembly fixation for proximal humerus fractures in the elderly.,"Purpose: A novel intra- and extramedullary assembly fixation method was introduced, which achieved good clinical results in complex proximal humeral fractures; however, evidence of its comparability with traditional fixation is lacking. This biomechanical study aimed to compare it with traditional fixation devices in osteoporotic proximal humeral fractures. Methods: Three-part proximal humeral fractures with osteopenia were created on 12 pairs of fresh frozen humerus specimens and allocated to three groups: 1) lateral locking plate, 2) intramedullary nail, and 3) intra- and extramedullary assembly fixation. The specimens were loaded to simulate the force at 25° abduction. Thereafter, an axial stiffness test and a compound cyclic load to failure test were applied. Structural stiffness, number of cycles loaded to failure, and relative displacement values at predetermined measurement points were recorded using a testing machine and a synchronized 3D video tracking system. Results: In terms of initial stiffness and the number of cycles loaded to failure, the intra- and extramedullary assembly fixation group showed notable improvements compared to the other groups (p <0.017). The mean relative displacement value of measurement points in the intra- and extramedullary assembly fixation group was smaller than that in the other two groups. However, there was no significant difference until 10,000 cycles. The mean relative displacement of the intramedullary nail group (3.136 mm) exceeded 3 mm at 7,500 cycles of loading. Conclusion: In this test model, axial fixation can provide better mechanical stability than non-axial fixation. The intra- and extramedullary assembly fixation is better able to prevent the varus collapse for elderly proximal humeral fractures with posteromedial comminution.",biomechanical analysis;hybrid fixation;intramedullary nail;locking plate fixation;osteopenia;proximal humeral fractures,trauma

Comparison of open and laparoscopic outcomes of adult Type-I congenital choledochal cysts.,"To compare open and laparoscopic outcomes of adult Type-I congenital choledochal cysts. Clinical data of 78 adult patients with Type-I congenital choledochal cysts, who had undergone cyst resection and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy in Chenzhou First People's Hospital from September 1, 2021 to August 31, 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who received open approach and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy constituted the open group (n=35,) and patients who received laparoscopic approach and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy were assigned into the laparoscopic group (n=43,). The intraoperative and postoperative conditions, relevant laboratory indicators, and the rate of complications were compared between the two groups. Intraoperative blood loss, postoperative time to first flatus, diet recovery time, time to drainage tube removal, and length of hospitalization of the laparoscopic group were lower in the laparoscopic group compared to the open group (P<0.05). One day after the operation, serum amylase (SAMY) levels in both groups were significantly lower, while the levels of total bilirubin(TBIL), alanine aminotransferase(ALT), and C-reactive protein(CRP) were higher than before the operation. Postoperative SAMY level in the laparoscopic group was significantly higher, while the postoperative TBIL and CRP levels were significantly lower than those in the open group (P<0.05). The incidence of postoperative complications in the laparoscopy group (4.65%) was significantly lower than the open group (20.00%) (P<0.05). Laparoscopic cyst resection combined with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is associated with lower extent of trauma, faster recovery, less inflammation, and fewer complications than open surgery in adult patients with Type-I congenital choledochal cysts.",Congenital choledochal cyst;Laparoscopy;Open surgery;Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy,trauma
Circulating miRNA expression in extracellular vesicles is associated with specific injuries after multiple trauma and surgical invasiveness.,"Two trauma treatment principles are Early Total Care (ETC), and Damage Control Orthopedics (DCO). Cellular mechanisms that underlie the connection between treatment type, its systemic effects, and tissue regeneration are not fully known. Therefore, this study aimed to: 1) profile microRNA (miRNA) expression in plasma derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from a porcine multiple trauma model at different timepoints, comparing two surgical treatments; and 2) determine and validate the miRNA's messengerRNA (mRNA) targets. The porcine multiple trauma model consisted of blunt chest trauma, liver laceration, bilateral femur fractures, and controlled haemorrhagic shock. Two treatment groups were defined, ETC (n=8), and DCO (n=8). Animals were monitored under Intensive Care Unit-standards, blood was sampled at 1.5, 2.5, 24, and 72 hours after trauma, and EVs were harvested from plasma. MiRNAs were analysed using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction arrays. MRNA targets were identified in silico and validated in vivo in lung and liver tissue. The arrays showed distinct treatment specific miRNA expression patterns throughout all timepoints, and miRNAs related to the multiple trauma and its individual injuries. EV-packed miRNA expression in the ETC group was more pro-inflammatory, indicating potentially decreased tissue regenerative capacities in the acute post-traumatic phase. In silico target prediction revealed several overlapping mRNA targets among the identified miRNAs, related to inflammation, (pulmonary) fibrosis, and Wnt-signalling. These were, among others, A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10, Collagen Type 1 Alpha 1 Chain, Catenin Beta Interacting Protein 1, and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3. Validation of these mRNA targets in the lung showed significant, treatment specific deregulations which matched the expression of their upstream miRNAs. No significant mRNA deregulations were observed in the liver. This study showed treatment specific, EV-packed miRNA expression patterns after trauma that correlated with mRNA expressions in the lungs, target organs over distance. A systemic response to the increased surgical trauma in the ETC group was identified, with various miRNAs associated with injuries from the trauma model, and involved in (systemic) inflammation, tissue regeneration. EV-transported miRNAs demonstrated a clear role in multiple trauma, warranting further research into tissue-tissue talk and therapeutic applications of EVs after trauma.","D013552:Swine;D000818:Animals;D000074166:Circulating MicroRNA;D013898:Thoracic Injuries;D014949:Wounds, Nonpenetrating;D035683:MicroRNAs;D007249:Inflammation;D009104:Multiple Trauma;D000067128:Extracellular Vesicles;D012333:RNA, Messenger",trauma
Buying time! VA-ECMO as a bridge to successful reoperative cardiac surgery in a case of traumatic tricuspid valve injury.,"Cardiac surgery performed on patients in cardiogenic shock is associated with a high mortality and morbidity. Preoperative Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) in cardiogenic shock gives critically-ill patients a chance for surgical intervention and is associated with better surgical outcomes. We present a 29-year-old male who had a ventricular septal defect closure as a child and presented with multi-organ injuries following polytrauma. He was in cardiogenic shock despite maximal inotropic support. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated torrential tricuspid regurgitation (TR) from a flail tricuspid valve (TV) leaflet as the cause of cardiogenic shock. He was stabilized on Veno-Arterial ECMO and underwent reoperative cardiac surgery. Intra-operatively, the anterior leaflet of his TV and its papillary muscle was detached from the right ventricle. He had a successful tissue TV replacement. Early surgery was indicated to treat right ventricular failure due to torrential TR, but due to his restricting non-cardiac injuries, ECMO was successfully used as a short-term support strategy and as a bridge to definitive surgery.",VA-ECMO;acute cardiogenic shock;case report;extra corporeal life support;traumatic cardiac injury;traumatic tricuspid valve injury,trauma
"Associations between alcohol intake and hospital contacts due to alcohol and unintentional injuries in 71,025 Danish adolescents - a prospective cohort study.","Alcohol is a leading risk factor to adolescent health. However, it is unclear how associations between alcohol intake and injuries are shaped. We investigated the dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and risk of hospital contacts due to alcohol and unintentional injuries in adolescents. We conducted a prospective cohort study including 71,025 Danish students aged 15-24 years, followed up for five years from 2014 to 2019. The main outcome measures were hospital contacts due to alcohol and unintentional injuries (all injuries and head injuries), obtained from hospital registers. Approximately 90% of males and females reported drinking alcohol, and the median intake among those was 11 drinks/week in males and 8 drinks/week in females. During five years of follow-up, 1.3% had an alcohol-attributable hospital contact, the majority of which were due to acute intoxication (70%). Alcohol-attributable hospital contacts were equally frequent in males and females and between age groups (15-17-year-olds vs 18-24-year-olds). Compared with never drinking, the adjusted incidence rate ratios for weekly intake of <7, 7-13, 14-20, 21-27, and >27 drinks/week were 1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.23-2.34), 1.77 (1.27-2.46), 1.91 (1.35-2.70), 2.34 (1.59-3.46), and 3.25 (2.27-4.64) for having an alcohol-attributable hospital contact within five years of follow-up. Restricting follow-up to one year more than doubled risk estimates. During the five years of follow-up, 27% incurred an unintentional injury. The most frequent types of injury were to the wrist or hand (27.6%), ankle or foot (25.2%), or head (12.4%). Injuries were more frequent among males (first-time incidence rate 110 per 1000 person-years) compared to females (82 per 1000 person-years), with no differences between age groups. Compared with never drinking, the adjusted incidence rate ratios for weekly intake of <7, 7-13, 14-20, 21-27, and >27 drinks were 1.09 (1.03-1.15), 1.14 (1.07-1.20), 1.25 (1.17-1.33), 1.38 (1.28-1.49), and 1.58 (1.47-1.69) for having a hospital contact for any type of unintentional injury within five years of follow-up. Results for the one-year follow-up period were comparable. Separate analysis for head injuries showed similar results as the analysis on all injuries. Results were generally similar in males and females. Adolescents' drinking is associated with a higher risk of acute harm in terms of hospital contacts due to alcohol and unintentional injuries in a dose-response relationship. Thus, increased risk was apparent in those with low alcohol intake, suggesting a need for awareness of and initiatives to prevent youth drinking. Furthermore, initiatives should include a strengthened focus on people younger than 18 years. This study was funded by the Tryg Foundation (ID: 153539) and The Helse Foundation (21-B-0359).",Adolescent health;Alcohol;Alcohol-attributable hospital contacts;Injuries;Intoxication,trauma
Additional Plate Fixation of Hinge Fractures After Varisation Distal Femoral Osteotomies Provides Favorable Torsional Stability: A Biomechanical Study.,"Hinge fractures are considered risk factors for delayed or nonunion of the osteotomy gap in distal femoral osteotomies (DFOs). Limited evidence exists regarding the treatment of hinge fractures after DFO, which could improve stability and thus bone healing. To (1) examine the effect of hinge fractures on the biomechanical properties of the bone-implant construct, (2) evaluate the biomechanical advantages of an additional fixation of a hinge fracture, and (3) test the biomechanical properties of different types of varisation DFOs. Controlled laboratory study. A total of 32 fresh-frozen human distal femora equally underwent medial closing wedge DFO or lateral opening wedge DFO using a unilateral locking compression plate. The following conditions were serially tested: (1) preserved hinge; (2) hinge fracture along the osteotomy plane; (3) screw fixation of the hinge fracture; and (4) locking T-plate fixation of the hinge fracture. Using a servo-hydraulic materials testing machine, we subjected each construct to 15 cycles of axial compression (400 N; 20 N/s) and internal and external rotational loads (10 N·m; 0.5 N·m/s) to evaluate the stiffness. The axial and torsional hinge displacement was recorded using a 3-dimensional optical measuring system. Repeated-measures 1-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni correction were used for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. Independent from the type of osteotomy, a fractured hinge significantly (P < .001) increased rotational displacement and reduced stiffness of the bone-implant construct, resulting in ≥1.92 mm increased displacement and ≥70% reduced stiffness in each rotational direction, while the axial stiffness remained unchanged. For both procedures, neither a screw nor a plate could restore intact rotational stiffness (P < .01), while only the plate was able to restore intact rotational displacement. However, the plate always performed better compared with the screw, with significantly higher and lower values for stiffness (+38% to +53%; P < .05) and displacement (-55% to -72%; P < .01), respectively, in ≥1 rotational direction. At the same time, the type of osteotomy did not significantly affect axial and torsional stability. Hinge fractures after medial closing wedge DFO and lateral opening wedge DFO caused decreased bone-implant construct rotational stiffness and increased fracture-site displacement. In contrast, the axial stiffness remained unchanged in the cadaveric model. When considering an osteosynthesis of a hinge fracture in a DFO, an additional plate fixation was the construct with the highest stiffness and least displacement, which could restore intact hinge rotational displacement.",biomechanics;hinge fixation;hinge fracture;torsional instability;varisation distal femur osteotomy,trauma
Surgical Treatment of a Neglected Thumb Volar Plate Injury in an 11-Year-Old Girl: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Volar plate injuries are rare and difficult to diagnose and treat. Only a few cases have been described on the thumb, especially in children, that resulted in swan-neck type deformity. Conservative treatment has been suggested as first-line management, but surgical reconstruction utilizing flexor digitorum superficialis tenodesis has been described for refractive cases. Only a few attempted surgical repairs of the volar plate have been reported, since it is a technically demanding procedure. CASE REPORT We present the case of a neglected thumb volar plate injury in an 11-year-old girl after a thumb hyperextension injury. The patient presented 2 months after her injury with functional disability of her thumb. Magnetic resonance imaging had been performed, with no signs of volar plate injury, and she was consequently treated with an extension-blocking splint, with no effect. Clinical examination raised the suspicion of a thumb volar plate injury, which was confirmed during surgical exploration. Therefore, fixation with a bone anchor was performed, and the metacarpophalangeal joint was immobilized in 20° flexion with a percutaneously inserted Kirschner wire. After splinting for 3 weeks, the patient had 10 sessions of physical therapy. At 6-week follow-up, she presented with excellent active and passive range of motion and absence of pain. CONCLUSIONS Magnetic resonance imaging did not have high sensitivity. Six weeks after surgery, full range of motion was achieved, with no stiffness or tenderness at the first metacarpophalangeal joint, suggesting that a thumb volar plate injury had been managed surgically with a suture anchor with excellent results.",D005260:Female;D002648:Child;D006801:Humans;D053401:Palmar Plate;D053656:Tenodesis;D019637:Orthopedic Procedures;D026741:Physical Therapy Modalities;D013933:Thumb;D006230:Hand Injuries,trauma
